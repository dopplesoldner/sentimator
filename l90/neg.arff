cv000_29416.txt,'Two teen couples go to a church party  , drink and then drive .  ^\n\nThey get into an accident .  ^\n\nOne of the guys dies  , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life  , and has nightmares .  ^\n\nWhat \'s   the deal  ?  ^\n\nWatch the movie and  \" sorta  \" find out   ...  ^\n\nCRITIQUE  : A mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea  , but presents it in a very bad package .  ^\n\nWhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write  , since I generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold  , mess with your head and such ( LOST HIGHWAY & MEMENTO  )  , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films  , and these folks just did n\'t   snag this one correctly .  ^\n\nThey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept  , but executed it terribly .  ^\n\nSo what are the problems with the movie  ?  ^\n\nWell  , its main problem is that it \'s   simply too jumbled .  ^\n\nIt starts off  \" normal  \" but then downshifts into this  \" fantasy  \" world in which you  , as an audience member  , have no idea what \'s   going on .  ^\n\nThere are dreams  , there are characters coming back from the dead  , there are others who look like the dead  , there are strange apparitions  , there are disappearances  , there are a looooot of chase scenes  , there are tons of weird things that happen  , and most of it is simply not explained .  ^\n\nNow I personally do n\'t   mind trying to unravel a film every now and then  , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again  , I get kind of fed up after a while  , which is this film \'s   biggest problem .  ^\n\nIt \'s   obviously got this big secret to hide  , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes .  ^\n\nAnd do they make things entertaining  , thrilling or even engaging  , in the meantime  ?  ^\n\nNot really .  ^\n\nThe sad part is that the Arrow and I both dig on flicks like this  , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point  , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense  , but it still did n\'t   the make the film all that more entertaining .  ^\n\nI guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is  \" into it  \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding .  ^\n\nI mean  , showing Melissa Sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy  !  !  ^\n\nOkay  , we get it  ... there are people chasing her and we do n\'t   know who they are .  ^\n\nDo we really need to see it over and over again  ?  ^\n\nHow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie  ?  ^\n\nApparently  , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves  , and it shows .  ^\n\nThere might \'ve   been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere  , but I guess  \" the suits  \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge  , would make more sense .  ^\n\nThe actors are pretty good for the most part  , although Wes Bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in AMERICAN BEAUTY  , only in a new neighborhood .  ^\n\nBut my biggest kudos go out to Sagemiller  , who holds her own throughout the entire film  , and actually has you feeling her character \'s   unraveling .  ^\n\nOverall  , the film does n\'t   stick because it does n\'t   entertain  , it \'s   confusing  , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime  , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it .  ^\n\nOh  , and by the way  , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick  ... it \'s   just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids .  ^\n\nIt also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since .  ^\n\nWhatever  ... skip it  !

cv004_12641.txt,'Story by Pierre David and Cyndi Pass.^\n\nWritten by Craig Hamann and Mark Evan    Schwartz .^\n\nDirected by Douglas Jackson .^\n\nStarring Maryam D\'Abo , Tod Fennell ,    Jay Underwood .^\n\nRated R ( contains violence , nudity , and profanity ) mins .    ^\n\nSynopsis : A mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from    a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy \'s  mother , a    fledgling restauranteur .^\n\nUnsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman \'s     favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way .    ^\n\nComments :  STALKED  is  yet  another  in a seemingly endless string of    spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge  type  movies which are a stable    category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video .   ^\n\nTheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they \'re  typically    inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as    vehicles  to  flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable    television ) .^\n\nSTALKED wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the    psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he \'s  rejected rather    quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) .^\n\nOther    than that , STALKED is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on    video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable .    ^\n\nSTALKED does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to    do . ^\n\nInterspersed  throughout  the  opening  credits ,  for instance , a    serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what    may cause a man to stalk ( it \'s  implicitly implied that all stalkers are men )    while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen .^\n\nAfter these credits , a    snapshot of actor Jay Underwood appears .^\n\nThe narrator states that \" this is    the story of Daryl Gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker .   ^\n\nOf course , really , this is the story of restauranteur Brooke Daniels .^\n\nIf the    movie was meant to be about Daryl , then it should have been called STALKER    not STALKED .    ^\n\nOkay . ^\n\nSo  we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no    guesswork required .^\n\nSTALKED proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious ,    obvious .^\n\nThe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings Daryl and    Brooke  ( the victim ) together .^\n\nDaryl obsesses over Brooke , follows her    around , and tries to woo her .^\n\nUltimately rejected by her , his plans become    more and more desperate and elaborate .^\n\nThese plans include the all-time ,    psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet .^\n\nFor some reason , this genre \'s     films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked .^\n\nSTALKED is no    exception ( it \'s  a cat this time --  found in the shower ) .^\n\nEvents like these    lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one    survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you \'ll  guess the conclusion    to this turkey ) .    ^\n\nSTALKED \'s  cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but    also not all that bad either .^\n\nJay Underwood , as the stalker , turns toward    melodrama a bit too much .^\n\nHe overdoes it , in other words , but he still    manages  to  be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story    demands .^\n\nMaryam D\'Abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she    played the Bond chick in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS ) , is equally adequate as the    \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a    strong , independent business-owner .    ^\n\nBrooke ( D\'Abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed .^\n\nToward    the end , for example , Brooke has her suspicions about Daryl .^\n\nTo ensure he    wo n\'t   use it as another excuse to see her , Brooke decides to return a    toolbox he had left at her place to his house .^\n\nDoes she just leave the    toolbox at the door when no one answers ?^\n\nOf course not .^\n\nShe tries the door ,    opens it , and wanders around the house .^\n\nWhen Daryl returns , he enters the    house , of course , so our heroine is in danger .^\n\nSomehow , even though her car    is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , Daryl is    oblivious to her presence inside .^\n\nThe whole episode places an incredible    strain on the audience \'s  suspension of disbelief and questions the validity    of either character \'s  intelligence .    ^\n\nSTALKED  receivesstarsbecause , even though it is highly derivative and    somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched .^\n\nRated R mostly    for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as    offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are .^\n\nIf you \'re  in the mood    for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else .

cv005_29357.txt,'In 2176 on the planet Mars police taking into custody     an accused murderer face the title menace .   ^\n\nThere is a lot of     fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise .   ^\n\nJohn     Carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films  ,     especially ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13  , that the new film comes off     as his homage to himself .   ^\n\nRating  : 4 ( 0 to 10  )  , 0 ( -4 to +4  ) .  ^\n\nJohn Carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes .  ^\n\nFor a writer and director of horror films  , supposedly an expert on horror  , it is a very bad mistake to make .   ^\n\nGHOSTS OF MARS is called a horror movie  , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace .   ^\n\nIn addition if anybody but John Carpenter had made GHOSTS OF MARS  , Carpenter would have grounds to sue .   ^\n\nThis film is just chock full of pieces taken from ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13  , THE THING  , and PRINCE OF DARKNESS .   ^\n\nIt is  , in fact  , surprising that Carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way .   ^\n\nBut that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience .  ^\n\nGHOSTS OF MARS takes place in the year 2176 .   ^\n\nMars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film \'s   budget  ) .   ^\n\nIt is never mentioned  , but the gravity on Mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal  , again making it easier to film .   ^\n\nSociety has changed a bit by that time  , but it has advanced surprisingly little .  ^\n\nApparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control .   ^\n\nAnd from Carpenter \'s   view  , women have really made a mess of things .   ^\n\nSociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten .  ^\n\nThe basic plot of GHOSTS OF MARS has much in common with that of ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 except that Precinct 9 ( yes  , Precinct 9  ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown Martian mining colony .   ^\n\nInstead of having the criminal  \" Napolean  \" Wilson  , this film has the criminal  \" Desolation  \" Williams .   ^\n\nInstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face  , well  , ghosts of Mars .   ^\n\nBecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner  , but they essentially behave as human savages  , in another lapse of imagination .   ^\n\nThe story is told in flashback  , flashback within flashback  , and flashback within flashback within flashback .  ^\n\nGHOSTS OF MARS takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red  , yellow  , and black .   ^\n\nCarpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene  , showing a mining train rushing through the Martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat .  ^\n\nSadly what follows is not really up to the buildup .   ^\n\nThe terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band Kiss .   ^\n\nHis idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring .   ^\n\nThese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience .   ^\n\nSomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the CGI digital decapitations in some of the fights .  ^\n\nWithin a short stretch of time we have seen the release of MISSION TO MARS  , RED PLANET  , and GHOSTS OF MARS .   ^\n\nAfter MISSION TO MARS was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by .   ^\n\nI rate GHOSTS OF MARS a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  ^\n\nFollowing the movie I showed my wife  , who liked GHOSTS OF MARS moderately more than I did  , Carpenter \'s   classic ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 .   ^\n\nHer comment is that it was seeing the same film twice .

familiar ) with the whole Mortal Kombat phenomenon , and that of a    fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games .    ^\n\nThe first movie ( MORTAL KOMBAT ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts    tournament  that  would  decide  the fate of Earth ( and it \'s  5 billion    inhabitants ) .^\n\nThe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the    Emperor Shao Khan from taking over the Earth .^\n\nUnfortunately , Shao Khan was a    poor loser , and the very final scene in MORTAL KOMBAT showed him arriving    anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting    stance .    ^\n\nThe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who    are fans of the game .^\n\nI \'d  even go so far as to say that many folks who    did n\'t  know about the game probably enjoyed the movie .^\n\nThe writers and    directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story    itself , and they did n\'t  try to overachieve .^\n\nThere were a lot of really cool    fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some    distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off    as a plot .^\n\nAnd , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box    office .    ^\n\nMORTAL KOMBAT : ANNIHILATION picks up precisely where that movie left off ,    with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the    first movie .^\n\nShao Khan has decided that he \'s  going to take over the Earth    anyways ,  and  to  Hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the    tournament .^\n\nThereafter follows approximatelyminutes of film that alternates    between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain    stupid .^\n\nOne gets the general impression that the producers of the movie    thought \" Hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money    and  make a real movie now . \"^\n\nToo bad they did n\'t  simply stick with the    formula from the first movie .    ^\n\nI could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but    here are the high points :     The acting is truly bad .^\n\nSandra Hess ( playing the Sonya Blade character ) is    particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us    that  she loved Johnny Cage ( a character from the first movie who gets    greased at the beginning of this movie ) .    ^\n\nIn one of the worst pieces of mis-casting I think I \'ve  ever seen , James    Remar plays Raiden , the God of Thunder .^\n\nIn the first movie , Christopher    Lambert played Raiden and played his character as though he was in on the    joke : A French actor playing a Japanese thunder god being revered by Chinese    mystics .    ^\n\nI generally like it when actors are cast against type ( Tim \" Tiny \" Lister ,    Jr.  being cast as the President of the U.S. in THE FIFTH ELEMENT , for    example ) , and Remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors But    he \'s  so totally wrong for this part that he does n\'t  even have the luxury of    amused self-awareness .    ^\n\nThere are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially    important , but then never seen again .    ^\n\nThere are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a    muddled scene where Liu Kang ( Robin Shou ) seeks out Nightwolf ( Litefoot ) ,    has  a  mystical  hallucination , and then wanders off with Jade ( Irina    Pantaeva ).     ... unless you \'re  a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie .^\n\nIn that    case , the following critiques also apply :     Sandra Hess , while being an even worse actress than Bridgette Wilson ( who    played  Sonya  Blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a    fighter .^\n\nWilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to    her by the fight choreographer .^\n\nHess looks like she actually knows some    martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene .    ^\n\nIn the fights , each of the characters does at least one thing they do in the    game  ( and  often  more ) .^\n\nSonya does her \" Kiss of Death , \" Jax does his    \" Earthquake , \" Liu Kang does his \" Animality , \" and so on .^\n\nA big bonus for    those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found    them only rarely .    ^\n\nThere are n\'t  as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first ,    because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot    in between .^\n\nSilly , silly folks .^\n\nAnd the lamest fight involved two of the    women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match .^\n\nLame and so obviously sexist    even I ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon    it .    ^\n\nThe special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene    between the Emporer and Liu Kang in which both perform their \" Animalities . \"   ^\n\nMotaro and Sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than Goro was in the    first movie .    ^\n\nFor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , I give    this a 5 .^\n\nYou \'ll  probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the    first one .

cv019_16117.txt,'Mighty Joe Young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla .   ^\n\nHis entrance  , however  , is a grand one  :  out from the trees he leaps  , gargantuan and imposing  , sporting hands big enough to crush a Volkswagen bug  , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have .   ^\n\nJoe bellows at the poachers before him  , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars .   ^\n\nDuring this scene  , I turned to my friend and said  ,  \" Wow .   ^\n\nThat \'s   some ape .  \"  ^\n\nJoe is quite a gorilla --   a big  , digital gorilla .   ^\n\nHe runs around the fields  , chasing cars and people .   ^\n\nHe picks things up and stares at them pensively .   ^\n\nHe breaks things on accident  , because he \'s   just too big to avoid clumsiness .   ^\n\nJoe  , as a special effect  , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes .   ^\n\nAs a character  , he does n\'t   quite register .   ^\n\nAnd the story he \'s   been put in is as limp as they come .   ^\n\nThe words  \" Family Entertainment  \" have never been a stamp of quality  , but Might Joe Young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart .  ^\n\nThe picture is a remake of the 1949 film .   ^\n\nIt \'s   mostly just about the big gorilla  , but  , strictly as a formality  , the movie also has a few human characters .   ^\n\nThe main one is Jill Young ( poor Charlize Theron  , forced to waste her talent  )  , a lover of gorillas .   ^\n\nAs a child  , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother  ; now  , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife .   ^\n\nSpecifically  , she \'s   out to protect Joe  , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood .    ^\n\nSoon  , zoologist Gregg O\'Hara ( Bill Paxton  ) discovers Joe  ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get Joe and sell him to a big game hunter named Strasser ( Rade Sherbedgia  )  , who just happens to be the same guy who killed Jill \'s   mother .   ^\n\nSo  , in an effort to save Joe  , Jill and Gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve  , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers .   ^\n\nIn addition  , the space is way too small for him ( after all  , he is a really big gorilla  ) .   ^\n\nAnd  , to add to the complications  , Strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells Jill that he has a preserve big enough for Joe  )  , and Joe recognizes Strasser as the guy who killed Jill \'s   mother .  ^\n\nJill  , of course  , does n\'t   recognize Strasser  , even though he did kill her mother .   ^\n\nThis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in Mighty Joe Young  , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a Special Effects Film .   ^\n\nThe movie is n\'t   really offensive --   it has some competent actors  , a few nifty sets  , and a lot of scenes with a big  , digitized gorilla .   ^\n\nBut the story is really dumb  , there are n\'t   any characters  , and the film is n\'t   satisfying on any level beyond its visuals .  ^\n\nThe movie also has bad dialogue .   ^\n\nIf a critic says that a film has bad dialogue  , it \'s   only fair to quote some of it  , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like  \" Joe is n\'t   happy  !  \" and  \" Joe is n\'t   safe here  !  \"   ^\n\n\" We need to get Joe out of here  !  \"   ^\n\n\" Joe is way too big for that cage  !  \"   ^\n\nI do n\'t   know if these phrases are word for word  , but they \'re   close .   ^\n\nAs I said  , the characters here are only present as a formality  :  they do little more than state the obvious ( of *course* Joe is too big for that cage  ) .   ^\n\nPaxton and Theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them .   ^\n\nSadly  , Mighty Joe Young wastes them both .  ^\n\nThere are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment  )  , and  , as I said  , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes .   ^\n\nIt \'s   certainly not a bad film for kids  ; I doubt Joe will give them nightmares .   ^\n\nBut adults in the audience are n\'t   likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla .   ^\n\nA big gorilla is only interesting for a little while  ; after that  , something needs to be done with the big gorilla .   ^\n\nNobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla .

cv022_14227.txt,'\"Knock Off\" is exactly that: a cheap knock off of an action movie.^\n\nIt \'s  also    the worst movie I have seen thus far this year .^\n\nI figured it would be at    least a couple of months before I saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it    has already been found .    ^\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme stars as ( I think ) a designer jeans executive who    discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods .^\n\nRob    Schneider plays Van Damme \'s  partner , and Rochon plays  ... actually , I have    no idea who Rochon was supposed to be .^\n\nShe just sort of popped up halfway    through without an explanation as to why she was there .^\n\nMany things are not    explained in this film , but I do know that for some bizarre reason , Van    Damme seemed to be doing a Jackie Chan impression throughout the flick .   ^\n\nWhere Chan comes off as endearing in his \" normal guy \" character seen in many    of his films , Van Damme just comes off as a wimp .^\n\nWe \'re  never given any    clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions .^\n\nTo be more clear :    I did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the    movie , and even then , it was not made too clear .    ^\n\nThe film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone    horribly wrong .^\n\nTsui Hark ( who directed Van Damme \'s  last movie , the bad , but    not nearly as bad as this , \" Double Team \" ) never lets the camera rest for a    second , and that \'s  no exaggeration .^\n\nWe are even treated to a five second    shot from the point of view of Van Damme \'s  foot entering a shoe .^\n\nFabulous !   ^\n\nSeriously , though , I have no problem with directors who want to play around    with film conventions , as long as they do n\'t  get carried away .^\n\nFor example ,    look at Sam Raimi .^\n\n\" Army of Darkness \" , one of his best movies , features some    of the most inventive camera work I have ever seen , but Raimi never lets the    special effects get in the way of story .^\n\nThat \'s  a concept that Tsui ca n\'t     seem to grasp .^\n\nThe special effects and outrageous camera angles rule \" Knock    Off \"  to the point where the audience does n\'t  have a clue as to what \'s     happening any more .    ^\n\nAnother problem with the film is that it looks cheap .^\n\nThe film stock used is    of such low caliber that I thought I was watching one of those Chinese films    shown really late at night .^\n\nAnd for some inexplicable reason , everyone \'s     voice  seems to have been dubbed .^\n\nEven the stars .^\n\nAnd even the special    effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared    about , are inconsistent .^\n\nFor example , there is a scene in which Van Damme    drives a car out of a window .^\n\nThe car slams into the ground , and the left    wheel is completely destroyed .^\n\nSeconds later , the car drives off at full    speed .^\n\nHey , I have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie ,    but a line must be drawn somewhere .    ^\n\nFinally , the acting .^\n\nNobody gives a good performance in this film .^\n\nVan    Damme , an actor I usually like , is way off the mark playing \" everyman \" .^\n\nAnd    Schneider , here to provide comic relief I assume , is totally unfunny and    over acts his way through every scene .^\n\nEven the usually solid Paul Sorvino    gives a terribly over-the-top performance as  ...^\n\nOnce again , I have no idea    who he was supposed to be .    ^\n\nIn case I have n\'t  yet made it clear enough , \" Knock Off \" is the worst movie    of Van Damme \'s  career and possibly the worst movie of the decade .^\n\nAnd it \'s     not even one of those movies that \'s  so bad it \'s  funny .^\n\nIt \'s  too inept to be    funny .^\n\nThere are no redeeming factors in \" Knock Off \" and I seriously hope    that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my    memory of watching the film can be erased. \n'
cv023_13847.txt,'\" Snake Eyes  \" is the most aggravating kind of movie  : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing .   ^\n\nIt \'s   not just because this is a Brian DePalma film  , and since he \'s   a great director and one who \'s   films are always greeted with at least some fanfare .   ^\n\nAnd it \'s   not even because this was a film starring Nicolas Cage and since he gives a brauvara performance  , this film is hardly worth his talents .   ^\n\nIt \'s   worse than that .   ^\n\nIt \'s   aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more  , could be totally intelligent  , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely  ... then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the Hall of Fame of Half-Assedness .   ^\n\nOr more deservedly  , the Hall of Fame of the Eighth-Assedness .  ^\n\nIn certain circles  ,  \" Snake Eyes  \" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of Kurosawa \'s   classic  \" Rashomon  ,  \" where a crime is told from the four different ( and I mean different  ) perspectives  , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening  , which  , I might add  , is superb .   ^\n\nIn one very very very long steadicam shot  , we meet the protagonist  , crooked Atlantic City detective  , Rick Santoro ( Cage  )  , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife  , interupts a pay-per-view event on TV  , chases down a gambler  , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight  , sits down and talks with his bud  , Kevin Dunne ( Gary Sinise  , who \'s   character should not be confused with that of actor Kevin Dunn  , who \'s   also in this  )  , and watches as it happens .  ^\n\nThere \'s   a big name in the crowd  , and that \'s   the Secretary of Defense  , Charles Kirkland ( Joel Fabiani  )  , who \'s   sitting behind Rick  , and who gets shot a second after the Heavyweight Champion  , Lincoln Tyler ( Stan Shaw  )  , is knocked out .   ^\n\nThis all happens in the opening shot  , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction .   ^\n\nWhat really happened  , this film asks  , and it sets this film up extremely well for when Rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene  ... and discovers there \'s   a very good possibility it was a conspiracy .  ^\n\nAs we follow Rick trying to learn of more information  , we also meet a woman who was talking to Kirkland before he was shot ( Carla Gugino  )  , and who flees the scene in a panic  , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness  \' takes on what happened .    ^\n\nThis is all going pretty fine and dandy  , and it \'s   extremely interesting to watch  ... then it takes one wrong step .   ^\n\nWe follow the wrong character  , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on  , and way before Rick can find it out .   ^\n\nBut that \'s   not the worst part of it  : it \'s   that it \'s   the one person you did n\'t   think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring  , the one you did n\'t   think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it .  ^\n\nIt only gets worse  : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film  , and since we already know what happened  , we ca n\'t   rely on Rick \'s   investigation to be all that interesting .   ^\n\nIt \'s   as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in  , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out  , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible .   ^\n\nEvents become more and more proposterous  , and by the end  , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this  : the deux ex machina .   ^\n\nThat \'s   where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay .   ^\n\nThis time  , it \'s   a hurricane  , an out-of-control police car  , and a big round ball that adorned the arena .  ^\n\nWhat went wrong  ?   ^\n\nDePalma and the screenwriter  , David Koepp  , are extremely credible people in their respective fields  , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this .   ^\n\nDePalma  , who idolizes Hitchcock to death  , has done many a film like this  , such as his masterpiece  ,  \" Blow Out  ,  \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece .    ^\n\nBut granted  , DePalma at least makes it intriguing to watch  , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups  , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel  , forgetting anything about boundaries .   ^\n\nAt least his direction makes up partly for it .  ^\n\nThen there \'s   Koepp  , who showed such great ability at making a character \'s   flaws come to life like he did in DePalma \'s   earlier  \" Carlito \'s   Way  ,  \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well .   ^\n\nHe can write a flawed character  , but his Rick Santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort .   ^\n\nHe \'s   flawed  , and we can see redemption if the story was n\'t   so formulaic .   ^\n\nA scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup .   ^\n\nHe may as well have said the opposite of what he says  ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like .  ^\n\nThis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity  , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption  , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way .   ^\n\nAs I was watching the first half hour  , I could n\'t   wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed  , how many different perspectives he \'d   be given  , and perhaps he \'d   have to make a choice between who \'s   he has to believe .   ^\n\nNow there \'s   a film .   ^\n\nUnfortunately  , the film has two major deux ex machinas  : one in the disasterous ending  ; the other  , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we \'ve   seen all too much before  , but never from someone like DePalma .

cv024_7033.txt,'Forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of THE CRUCIBLE infects.    ^\n\nSet in 1692 at Salem , Massachusetts , THE CRUCIBLE opens with a group of    teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in    the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon .^\n\nThey beckon the names    of men as the targets of their love spells .    ^\n\nThen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes .^\n\nNot to be    outdone in her quest to regain the attention of John Proctor ( Daniel Day    Lewis ) , Abigail ( Winona Ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against    the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood .^\n\nTaking even    adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a    bit excessive , especially for prim Puritan sensibilities ?^\n\nSurely to the    Puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ?    ^\n\nTHE CRUCIBLE errs from the beginning and Arthur Miller \'s  name should be    summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen    adaptation of his play .^\n\nThis is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an    already shaky morality tale .    ^\n\nThe play describes the film \'s  opening scene during tense exchanges that    makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this    adds to the play \'s  charged atmosphere .    ^\n\nIn the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional Pandora \'s  box .^\n\nNot    only  is  credulity stretched but Abigail \'s  obsession is unfortunately    spotlighted .^\n\nIt positions THE CRUCIBLE more as a cautionary fable about    obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back    the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot .    ^\n\nNot surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when    two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those    eager to blame .^\n\nWhen the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is    accompanied  with  an announcement of their return to God and they are    thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by Abigail .^\n\nWith    alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and    point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that Abigail \'s     passion  sets  all this into inexorable motion .^\n\nAbigail seizes on this    opportunity to rid herself of her rival for John Proctor \'s  love , his wife    Elizabeth ( Joan Allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft .    ^\n\nAppropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile    ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , Day Lewis    plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be    watched . ^\n\nDirector Nicholas Hytner is guilty of encouraging Day Lewis \'    foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at Proctor as if he was    mounted on a pedestal for our admiration .^\n\nOtherwise , Hytner \'s  direction is    unremarkable .    ^\n\nRyder \'s  performance as Abigail is as consistent as her mood swings .^\n\nHer fits    of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful .   ^\n\nAbigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but Ryder fails at being    convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here .^\n\nPaul    Scofield is fine as the overzealous Judge Danforth , but the incessant moral    posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the    young girls pricks at the nerves .    ^\n\nProbably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing    and puffing , Allen \'s  Elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character .   ^\n\nA scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned    Elizabeth and John is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a    reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed .   ^\n\nUnfortunately , when John \'s  audience again increases to more than one his    urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost .    ^\n\nIt  is  clear that Miller meant well but I do wish he did it with more    delicacy and fewer diversions .^\n\nHis screenplay is an imperfect creature with    the distractions coming out as loud as the message .^\n\nThe result is a clumsy    muddle - I felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly    banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable .^\n\nWhen the    gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed .    ^\n\nFar from bewitching , THE CRUCIBLE tests the patience .    ^\n\n'

cv027_26270.txt,'REINDEER GAMES is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by Ehren    Kruger (SCREAMand ARLINGTON RD are the others, each derivative in their own    special way).^\n\nThe guy ca n\'t  seem to write believable dialogue ( Sample from    REINDEER GAMES : \" Rule #1 : Never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create    multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows    how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one    deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) .^\n\nHis screenplay for REINDEER    GAMES turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film    becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight .^\n\nI can    just envision Kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" Oh you thought my movie    was gonna go here , fck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother    fcker ! \"^\n\nIt \'s  almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money    to see his stupid movie .^\n\nAnd why the hell would anyone want to invest time    in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason    other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ?^\n\nAuteur theory    be  damned ; it \'s  Kruger \'s  \" style \" , not the director \'s  that winds up on    screen . ^\n\nKruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut    \" sometimes less is more \" .^\n\nAnd his numerous twists ca n\'t  even claim to be    originals ; ARLINGTON RD \'s  ending is a direct steal from the much better Alan    J. Pakula thriller THE PARALLAX VIEW , and in REINDEER GAMES we get this ol\'    gem ; Character incriminates themself by saying something they should n\'t  know    ( pronouns  used  to protect the gender of the \" character\" ... grammar be    damned ) .^\n\n\" How did you know that ? \" the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly    realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along. .  .    ^\n\nSince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how Kruger \'s     screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , I    guess it \'s  no wonder why he works so frequently .^\n\nHe \'s  quickly becoming    MIRAMAX \'s   Mickey Mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on    several of their upcoming projects .^\n\nThis is appropriate considering that    MIRAMAX ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically    daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports    ( LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL ) and Freddie Prinze Jr. vehicles .^\n\nTheir company \'s  current    logo could be \" We ride the trends \" .    ^\n\nREINDEER GAMES stars Ben Affleck as Rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal    spending  his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies    dancing atop his head .^\n\nAlthough Affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to    insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like Steve Guttenberg preciously    mugging through a POLICE ACADEMY flick .^\n\nAffleck is such a puppy dog that    it \'s  impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment    without becoming nearly everyone \'s  bitch .    ^\n\nThe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the    plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self    consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as I can    recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting .^\n\nIt may have been wiser had the film    makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting Jerry Seinfeld as    the hardened criminal and Howard Stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who \'s     played here by Gary Sinise in yet another over the top villain performance )     James Frain is Nick , Rudy \'s  cellmate , a manslaughterer who \'s  found a pen pal    in the gorgeous Ashley Mason ( Charlize Theron ) .^\n\nAshley is a prison groupie    who sends Nick many cheesecake photos of her though she \'s  never seen one    picture of him .^\n\nWhich works out fine since the character is killed in a    near-riot , and Rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as Nick ) takes    his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between    Ashley and Rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit    from Ashley \'s  brother , Gabriel ( Gary Sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby    hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts .^\n\nHe plans to rob an Indian    Casino on Christmas Eve with the assistance of Rudy who he thinks is Nick    who , according to what he wrote in the letters to Ashley , used to work as a    guard in the Indian casino .^\n\nThough by the end , the film pulls the rug out    from under us so frequently that everything I \'ve  described might as well be    irrelevant .    ^\n\nThis is what you can expect should you chose to take this Reindeer on ;    several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to    stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and    crack a stupid one-liner .^\n\nIncluded : Two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad    guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him    ( one following the other no less ) .^\n\nThough it \'s  an action film , the ending is    more  a  talkfest  where we get the whole movie explained to us by one    flustered character actor after another while Affleck looks on , incredulous    as the audience .    ^\n\nThe flick was directed by John Frankenheimer , a straightforward action    director who lucked into THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE early in his career , fell    off the A-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is    slowly climbing his way back up .^\n\nIt would be a success story if he were    choosing better scripts but his last major film was RONIN ( one of those    almost but not quite movies ) which followed THE ISLAND OF DR.MORNEAU ( you    remember , the one with Marlon Brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering    moo-moo ) , and now this .^\n\nHe films action sequences with a minimum of quick    cutting which I like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly    comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a    brain-zapped MTV audience to pick apart .^\n\nProblem is these action scenes    ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to    further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their    watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play .    ^\n\nCharacter problems abound ; Rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door    earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at    this point ) something Ben Affleck is capable of pulling off .^\n\nThe former he    can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while    those around him growl and swear .^\n\nBut then suddenly Affleck starts growling    and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a Tarantino    gangster .    ^\n\nCharlize Theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like Affleck , playing whatever    part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one    moment , anger at the next .^\n\nShe never has a chance to evince any charm or    make  much  of  an  impression  beyond her obvious physical attributes    ( Frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this .    ^\n\nGary Sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in SNAKE EYES , he    does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must    be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of    control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it    becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ) than a threat .^\n\nThese    are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with    little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its    audience.

cv031_19540.txt,'Some movies I should just skip.^\n\nMy daughter and I had a really vile time at    My  Favorite  Martian  a few weeks back , and here comes another Disney    effects-filled live-action flick based on an old TV program .^\n\nTrue , the    probgram is onlyyears old this time , and it \'s  a cartoon .^\n\nBut it \'s  a cartoon    I liked , and I was understandably reluctant to see what Disney had done to    it on the big screen .^\n\nBut my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could    it be ?    ^\n\nTurns out I was right , mostly .^\n\nInspector Gadget , oddly enough , follows    almost  exactly  the  same  format as My Favorite Martian , down to the    jive-talking side-kick .^\n\nAt first I thought it was done by the same people ,    but IMDB informs me that IG was directed by David Kellogg and written by    Dana Olsen and Kerry Ehrin , where MFM was directed by Donald Petrie and    written by Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver .    ^\n\nThis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the    studio that produced it , where \" formula \" is n\'t  just business , it \'s  a way of    life .^\n\nThe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get    prominant screen credits .^\n\nIn some parts you can just hear them saying \" more    zany !^\n\nI want more zany here --  and --  here . \"^\n\n\" Let \'s  have a really painful    sexual reference for no reason right here --  make it really painful .^\n\nI want    the audience squirming in their seats . \"^\n\n\" Ok , that \'s  fine , but I want you to    add bug guts . \"^\n\n\" What does this scene do ?^\n\nCharacter depth ?^\n\nBut where \'s  the    zaniness ?^\n\nI DO N\'T  see ZANY here .^\n\nIf you ca n\'t  make it zany , cut it ! \"    ^\n\nThe latter is the only explanation I can come up with for the absence of the    thoroughly charming Michelle Trachtenberg for most of the movie .^\n\nMichelle    ( who  plays Penny , Gadget \'s  niece ) shines in every scene she \'s  in , but    unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time .^\n\nMy guess is    that the rest is on the cutting room floor .    ^\n\nDabney Coleman \'s  comedic talents are utterly wasted as Chief Quimby .^\n\nI kept    expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film ,    but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few    unexceptional  scenes .^\n\nHe is thoroughly upstaged by Cheri Oteri as the    \" gidget  bitch  from hell \" town Mayor .^\n\nOteri \'s  overly enthusiastic and    continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much    like Portland , Oregon \'s  own manic mayor Vera Katz that I had to wonder if    the  studio  was n\'t   poking fun at our fair town .^\n\nOr , maybe all career    politicians are like that .    ^\n\nI must say , Matthew Broderick does not stroll through Inspector Gadget as he    did Godzilla .^\n\nHe appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the    evil Gadget .^\n\nRupert Everett is entertaining as the maniacle Claw .    ^\n\nJoely Fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany    carbon copy of herself .^\n\nHer performance is one of the few things worth    watching in the film .    ^\n\nD.L.

B. Woodside as Issac \'s  son , Colin .^\n\nThe performance is    undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance    with whatever location he is in .^\n\nAn unfocused performance that should have    been reigned in and  / or better written .    ^\n\nFirst time director Andrzej Bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling    the film .^\n\nHaving a career as one of the industry \'s  best cinematographers ,    Bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and \" Romeo Must Die \" does look    good .^\n\nBut the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of    life during the fight scenes .^\n\nThe script by Eric Bernt and John Jarrell is    not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the    situations they are in .^\n\nThe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to    facilitate the building of a sports center for a NFL team is needlessly    confusing .^\n\nAnd of course the common practice of one character being the    comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as Anthony Anderson    as Allayah \'s  bodyguard , Maurice has no comic timing whatsoever .    ^\n\nThe best things about the film are its fight scenes .^\n\nJet Li is a master of    these intricate physical battles .^\n\nOne needs only to see his film \" Fist of    Legend \" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of Martial    Art combat .^\n\nHere , Jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that    \" Lethal Weapon 4 \" ( Jet \'s  U.S. debut ) did n\'t  allow .^\n\nUnfortunately , a lot of    Jet \'s  fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability    and  precision .^\n\nAlso \" Romeo Must Die \" must be noted as having the most    singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray    effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the    effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent .^\n\nObviously a homage to the    famed x-ray scene from Sonny Chiba \'s  \" Streetfighter \" , the scenes here are    just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film .^\n\nIt \'s  as if the    film has stopped and a video game has been inserted .    ^\n\nOne problem though about the fight scenes .^\n\nThose that are familiar with Hong    Kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed    from reality as any anime or cartoon .^\n\nThey do have an internal rhythm to    them .^\n\nA heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography .^\n\nThe fight scenes in a    Hong Kong film breath with an emotional resonance .^\n\nThis is created by the    performance , the direction and the editing .^\n\nHere in \" Romeo Must Die \" , there    is  no staccato .^\n\nEvery fight scene , even though technically adroit and    amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and    simple follows a set pattern .^\n\nThe rhythm is monotonous .^\n\nA Hong Kong film has    a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact. \'RMD\' is limited to    a standard tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever .    ^\n\nA fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of    Jackie Chan \'s  films.. watch the restaurant fight from the film \" Rush Hour \"    and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is    rather  flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) .^\n\nNow look at the    warehouse fight from \" Rumble in the Bronx \" .^\n\nThere you have a heartbeat , and    emotional draw that does n\'t  let the audience catch its breath .^\n\nThe stops and    pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both    astounded and flabbergasted .^\n\nHere in \'Romeo Must Die\' , the fight scenes have    no more emotional content or character than any John Wayne barroom brawl .    ^\n\nJet Li is a grand and personable screen presence. it \'s  a shame that his full    talents were not used to full effect here .^\n\nOne day filmmakers here in the    U.S. will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style    and emotion that has made Hong Kong action pictures such a commodity .^\n\nUntil    then , we \'ll  be left with emotionally hollow product like \" The Replacement    Killer \" and , currently \" Romeo Must Die \" .    ^\n\nOwned and Copyright 2000 R.L.

cv036_18385.txt,'Among multitude of erotic thrillers  , that had been released in the early 1990s  , WOMAN OF DESIRE is interesting only because it was directed by Robert Ginty  , star of the B-grade action films of the previous decade .  ^\n\nThose who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made Ginty the star .  ^\n\nAs director  , Ginty did very little to improve that impression .  ^\n\nThe protagonist of the movie is Jack ( played by Jeff Fahey  )  , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with Christina Ford ( played by Bo Derek  ) .  ^\n\nHowever  , she has relationship with rich and powerful Jonathan Ashby ( Steven Bauer  ) .  ^\n\nOne stormy night  , the tragedy occurs and Jack is accused of rape and murder .  ^\n\nHowever  , his good friend Walter J. Hill ( Robert Mitchum  ) happens to be very good lawyer  , so Jack might even prove his innocence in the end .  ^\n\nBelonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller  , WOMAN OF DESIRE distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , this film is n\'t   comedy and any laugh is unintentional .  ^\n\nThe characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them .  ^\n\nThe actors that play them do n\'t   help either .  ^\n\nThat is especially the case with Jeff Fahey  , whose Jack is so stupid that even the character played by Fahey in LAWNMOWER MAN looks like a genius in comparison .  ^\n\nHis partner Bo Derek  , on the other hand  , shows that she did n\'t   age enough to cease being the sex goddess  , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents .  ^\n\nGinty  , on the other hand  , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting  , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer .

Out of Sight director Steven Sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in    The Limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller .^\n\nThough the plot    description may at first seem like it came from the pen of Elmore Leonard    ( author  of Out of Sight , as well as Jackie Brown , Get Shorty and Pulp    Fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it \'s  not nearly good enough .    ^\n\nIn an aggressively non-linear fashion , The Limey ( limey , noun : an English    gentleman ) tells the story of Wilson ( Terrence Stamp ) , a British ex-con just    released from ayear stint in prison for armed robbery .^\n\nHe has come to the US    to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter Jenny .^\n\nHe does n\'t  know much    about  the  circumstances  of  her demise , all he has is a name : Terry    Valentine .^\n\nValentine was Jenny \'s  former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt    record executive .^\n\nHe \'s  played by Peter Fonda , in his first major role since    the terrific Ulee \'s  Gold in 1997 .    ^\n\nSeeking Valentine \'s  reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy    task for Wilson .^\n\nHe finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains    and sneaks in just as Valentine is having a big party .^\n\nHe winds up breaking    his cover eventually , setting off Valentine \'s  head of security and Valentine    himself , who decides to run for it .    ^\n\nWhat a mess .^\n\nI have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the    linearity of time --  Pulp Fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a    masterpiece --  but I do take exception to movies that decide to play around    with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer .^\n\nThe Limey does    exactly that .^\n\nThe plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what    can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose .   ^\n\nThere is no method to this movie \'s  madness .^\n\nIt uses a fancy way to tell a    story  that  would  be  better  off  told more conventionally and more    comprehendably .    ^\n\nThe plot is n\'t  particularly interesting in the first place : traditional ,    mildly hackneyed and not very involving .^\n\nThis is a sort of brooding film --     our protagonist does n\'t  speak much and the action sequences are done with an    annoyingly  perfunctory attitude .^\n\nI felt like the director was n\'t  very    interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a    paycheck .^\n\nDitto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and    unpleasant .    ^\n\nSixties icon Terrence Stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging    criminal .^\n\nHe \'s  not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly    imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here .^\n\nPeter Fonda is    an unbelievably underrated actor : he \'s  shy , quiet but always effective .^\n\nHe \'s     adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his    feelings do n\'t  always show on his face by you can always tell what they are .    ^\n\nThis is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre    fashion .^\n\nWhy Soderbergh could n\'t  just parrot down and tell a story , I do n\'t     know , but what he does do certainly does n\'t  work .^\n\nThe result is a wild    cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil --  even the action scenes    do n\'t  work .^\n\n1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one -    act  two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet    transcended it .^\n\nShall we go back to basics ?

cv048_18380.txt,'Sydney Lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality .  ^\n\nHe is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades  , like TWELVE ANGRY MEN  , SERPICO or THE VERDICT .  ^\n\nBut  , in the same time  , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper Lumet \'s   reputation .  ^\n\nA STRANGER AMONG US  , 1992 rip-off of Peter Weir \'s   WITNESS  , belongs to the latter category .  ^\n\nThe heroine of this movie is Emily Eden ( Melanie Griffith  )  , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of New York .  ^\n\nDuring one of such actions  , her partner Nick ( Jamey Sheridan  ) got hurt and as a result  , she becomes depressed .  ^\n\nIn order to help her recover  , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to Hassidic Jew community .  ^\n\nEmily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder .  ^\n\nConcluding that the perpetrator belongs to community  , she decides to go undercover .  ^\n\nThat is n\'t   easy  , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways .  ^\n\nThings get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar Ariel ( Eric Thal  ) .  ^\n\nUsing Peter Weir \'s   formula is n\'t   the greatest flaw of this film .  ^\n\nEven the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent .  ^\n\nBut the worst insult to viewer \'s   audience is terrible miscasting of Melanie Griffith .  ^\n\nThe author of this review never liked this actress very much  , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles .  ^\n\nRole of Emily Eden  , unfortunately  , is n\'t   one of them .  ^\n\nFirst of all  , she ca n\'t   pass for tough NYPD street fighter  , and her attempt to pass for Orthodox Jewish woman is n\'t   much better .  ^\n\nScreenplay by Robert J. Avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two Italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch  ) .  ^\n\nBut  , on the other hand  , other actors are more convincing ( Lee Richardson as an old rabbi  , Thal as Ariel and charming Mia Sara as his intended bride  )  , and the photography by Andrzej Bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in Hassidic community .  ^\n\nAlso  , the film might educate viewers about Hassidic culture .  ^\n\nThat is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time .

cv062_24556.txt,'There are two things the American film industry should avoid at all costs .   ^\n\nOne is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels    into a feature film .^\n\nTwo is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring John    Travolta .^\n\nTo wit , we present the disaster that is Battlefield Earth .    ^\n\nA  science-fiction  opus  starring  the Barbarino of the Actors Guild ,    Battlefield Earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a    prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior .^\n\nSci-fi is always a tricky    beast : Tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and    the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs .^\n\nBattlefield    Earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes .    ^\n\nHere \'s  the `plot.\'^\n\nThe year is 3000 .^\n\nMankind has been become an endangered    species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the Psychlos    ( sounds like either the latest clown act from Cirque de Soleil or a white    rap group ) .^\n\nA small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the    Rockies in fear of the `demons \' who dwell in the cities below .^\n\nThe Psychlos    are strip-mining the Earth for its resources and Terel , played by Travolta ,    is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in Denver .    ^\n\nA young rogue named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler , played with dramatic flair by    Barry Pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover    the truth about the `demons.\'^\n\nHe is promptly captured and taken to the alien    base .^\n\nAfter several attempts at escape , Johnnie is placed in the middle of    an underhanded subplot of Terel \'s  , involving circumventing gold from an    exposed vein in the Rockies to his own end .^\n\nJonnie , assumed leader of the    mining  slave  group ,  then  manages  to  attain all Psychlo and human    intelligence through a learning machine Terel forces him to use .^\n\nThen the    story just runs along until Jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics    of trigonometry , the Bill of Rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to    fly a Harrier jet .^\n\nThe whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious    gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits .    ^\n\nRoger Christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented    Dune ,  Blade  Runner ,  Planet of the Apes , Independence Day , Stargate ,    Beastmaster , the Airwolf episodes , the `V\' miniseries , The Matrix , and The    Omega Man  ... and decided to steal every scene he could for Battlefield    Earth .^\n\nChristian even shoots every scene in a weird Dutch angle titled left    or right for every frame of the movie !^\n\nAnd every scene in the movie ends    with a middle wipe --  really .    ^\n\nThe Psychlos reminded me of a cross between Jamaican basketball players with    bad  teeth  and bloated hands and Klingon extras working the Star Trek    convention circuit .^\n\nTravolta \'s  acting has n\'t  been this bad since The Experts    or maybe Perfect .^\n\nJonnie Goodboy Tyler evolves into William Wallace with    lines  like `You can have your freedom if you fight!\'^\n\nThen there \'s  the    script : The film just never convinces you that the plight of Jonnie in    teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet\' would be a    difficult task to achieve .^\n\nWhy ?^\n\nBecause Terel provides all the necessary    tools to incite a revolt --  for no particular reason beside the fact that    `humans are stupid.\'    ^\n\nTerel may be right , you know .^\n\nHumans made this movie .    ^\n'

cv064_25842.txt,'I \'ve   never fully understood Wesley Snipes \'s   career .  ^\n\nHe has his ups and downs  ,  but mostly the downs .  ^\n\nHis best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that  movie was entitled  \" Blade  \" .  ^\n\nHe has had his typical action movies  ,  \" Boiling  Point  \"  ,  \" Passenger 57  \"  , but his new movie  \" The Art of War  \" should just be  called  \" Rising Sun 2  : The Art of War  \" cause basically it \'s   a semi-remake of  the same plot  , with a different cast  , and forced to be a ridiculously  unbelievable thriller  , that is high on style and low on substance .   ^\n\nWesley Snipes plays a James Bondish type secret agent working for the U.N.

cv066_11668.txt,'Mr. Nice Guy is the latest Jackie Chan film  , so you should know what to expect .   ^\n\nA weak plot  , terrible dialogue  , very little acting ability  , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile .  ^\n\nHowever  , Mr. Nice Guy lacks the sparkle of Jackie \'s   best efforts  , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever .  ^\n\nJackie Chan plays  , who else  , Jackie .   ^\n\nThis time out  , he \'s   a famous chef who hosts an Australian cooking show .   ^\n\nNot that it ever makes a difference in the plot .   ^\n\nThere are only two scenes of him cooking .   ^\n\nFor the rest of the film  , somehow he mutates into Jackie Chan  , Supercop .   ^\n\nIt never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills  ... perhaps he was in the same cooking class as Steven Seagal in Under Siege  ?  ^\n\nA TV newswoman  , Diana ( Gabrielle Fitzpatrick  )  , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin Giancarlo ( Richard Norton  ) and a local gang of toughs  , The Demons .  ^\n\nAlthough she only has one camcorder  , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles  ... hmmm  , shades of Broadcast News  ?  ?  ?   ^\n\nAnyway  , the goons discover Diana  , and will do anything to recover the tape .  ^\n\nHere lies another crucial flaw in the story  :  does n\'t   anyone realize you can copy a tape  ?   ^\n\nOh well  , no one ever said Jackie Chan movies had to make sense .  ^\n\nAs luck would have it  , Diana runs across Jackie  , and  , would n\'t   you know it  , Jackie accidentally ends up with the tape .   ^\n\nThis leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from Rumble in the Bronx or nearly any other Jackie Chan movie .  ^\n\nIn a move apparently designed to woo American ( and other English-speaking  ) audiences  , the film uses English as its primary language .   ^\n\nHowever  , that does n\'t   mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted Jackie \'s   recent Americanized releases .   ^\n\nStrangely  , many of the characters speaking English are overdubbed with English  , and poorly too .   ^\n\nWhether this is just a very bad case of looping  , an effort to minimize accents  , or a simple case of nostalgia  , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of Jackie \'s   dubbed films .  ^\n\nThe plot in Mr. Nice Guy is negligible  , merely an excuse to have Jackie on the run from various goons .   ^\n\nBut even though plots have always been second to the action in Jackie \'s   films  , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread .  ^\n\nLook  , if you have Jackie Chan playing a chef  , why not use that to your advantage  ?   ^\n\nWatching Jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen  , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts .  ^\n\nThe action is a mixed bag here .   ^\n\nThere \'s   really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of Jackie \'s   films .   ^\n\nIt takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site  , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala Jackie Chan .   ^\n\nThe action in the film is neither Jackie \'s   best nor worst  , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes .  ^\n\nThe film \'s   gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting .   ^\n\nOnce or twice  , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence .   ^\n\nBut to slo-mo Jackie running  ?   ^\n\nEither this is a nod to the Six-Million Dollar Man  , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that Jackie may be slowing down .  ^\n\nIf you \'ve   seen all of Jackie \'s   films and are in need of another fix  , go ahead and see Mr. Nice Guy .   ^\n\nHowever  , if you \'re   just in the mood for some good action  , you \'d   be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work  , such as Supercop .

cv067_21192.txt,'\"First rule of Fight Club is, don\'t talk about fight club.\"^\n\nThis quote deals    directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it \'s  not even    worth mentioning .^\n\nDirector David Fincher ( Seven ) has completely gone over    the edge .^\n\nWith crude humor , an intolerable script andhours andminutes of    pure torture , I \'m  surprised I did n\'t  walk out .^\n\nThis just goes to show that    hype kills .^\n\nIt \'s  very rare that a film so hyped up as \" Fight Club \" turns out    to be noteworthy , and this is no exception .^\n\nThe story goes like this .^\n\nEdward    Norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a    variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets Marla ( Helena Bonham    Carter ) .^\n\nNorton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when    he spots her at a session that he also attended .^\n\nApparently the disease    sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain .^\n\nWhy any    person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse .   ^\n\nNorton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it \'s  on a    plane that he meets Tyler Durden ( Brad Pitt ) .^\n\nThe two men develop a bond ,    and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful    characters  fight . ^\n\nHow do they come up with this stuff ?^\n\nAnyway , their    fighting catches other pathetic loser \'s  attention , and a club is formed .^\n\nOut    of all this mess , there manages to lie a message .^\n\nFincher shows us that    society is like robots .^\n\nWe work in our jobs doing things step by step , and    want out .^\n\nOur insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they    really are , and we blame it on others .^\n\nCall me crazy , but this is common    knowledge .^\n\nI think Fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more    poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails    miserably .^\n\nEven with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage    to weaken the story .^\n\nI could n\'t  help but hide my face in shame when Norton    beats himself up into a bloody pulp .^\n\nIt just shows how desperate the script    is for attention .^\n\nI guess Brad Pitt was right for this role , because I felt    like beating him up myself .^\n\nHis bothersome and depressing character , made me    disgusted at his 20 million fee .^\n\nIt only showed me that he was in it for the    money and nothing more .^\n\nHelena Bonham Carter however really had no purpose .   ^\n\nShe just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left .^\n\nThis    continues for what seems like 6 hours .^\n\nThe film drags on and my headache    gets  bigger ,  while \" Fight Club \" nears what I think might be the end .   ^\n\nUnfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom .^\n\nThough the conclusion kept    my interest for a mereminutes , it backs down again and continues to move at    a snails pace .^\n\nOn a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements    of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did    on the trailer .^\n\nFincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least    learn a lesson .^\n\nConcentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment ,    wo n\'t  do any good if everything else is in need of support .^\n\nAlso , I \'m  afraid    that immature men might respond to the film \'s  violence .^\n\nThe last thing the    world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult .^\n\nWhen the film    ends , I \'m  just glad to get home and take some advil .^\n\nYou \'ll  either enjoy    what the film has to offer , or agree with Ed Norton when he says \" This is so    Fing stupid . \" '

cv070_13249.txt,'ARMAGEDDON   ^\n\nIt rocks-actually  , lots of rocks fly at us or from us  , in slow or fast motion  , at several points in the film .  ^\n\nThey seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward  , and when they land-once in a while  , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the Chrysler building and the like .  ^\n\n( Nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur .  )  ^\n\nThey also just might be the most interesting element of ARMAGEDDON  , a steroid user \'s   answer to Deep Impact .  ^\n\nBruce Willis stars as Harry Stamper  , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the White House and NASA to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond  \" zero barrier  \" and destroys our planet .  ^\n\nWhy an oil driller  ?

cv079_12766.txt,'Over 40 years ago  , a Japanese production company called Toho introduced the Land of the Rising Sun to Gojira  , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind \'s   nuclear testing .   ^\n\nPartly flight of fancy  , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry  , Gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize Tokyo .   ^\n\nA year later  , GOJIRA was marketed to the United States by adding three things  :  A new name  , a dubbed English track  , and Raymond Burr .   ^\n\nAs GODZILLA  , the film took on the rest of the world .   ^\n\nThirty years later  , Toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the American market by adding the same three things ( yes  , including Raymond Burr  ) and called it GODZILLA 1985 .   ^\n\nNow it \'s   14 years after Toho \'s   remake  , and director Roland Emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an American first run .  ^\n\nIn Emmerich \'s   GODZILLA  , Matthew Broderick plays Dr. Niko Tatopoulos  , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the South Pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms .   ^\n\nWhen the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the Hudson River  , Tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the States .  ^\n\nMeanwhile  , Tatopoulos \'s   college girlfriend  , Audrey Timmonds ( Maria Pitillo  )  , works in New York City as an assistant to a big-time news reporter .   ^\n\nShe \'d   like to be a reporter herself  , and when Godzilla comes ashore  , she figures this is her big break .   ^\n\nOf course  , with the big guy running amok in the city  , Niko and Audrey are bound to cross paths  , and are joined by Victor  \" Animal  \" Palotti ( Hank Azaria  )  , Audrey \'s   trusty cameraman friend  , and Phillipe Roche ( Jean Reno  )  , an operative for the French government  , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place .   ^\n\nTogether they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive Godzilla .  ^\n\nWith the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation \'s   premiere movie production companies  , one would think Emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name GODZILLA .   ^\n\nHe did n\'t   . ^\n\nRight up there with THE LOST WORLD  , GODZILLA is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history .  ^\n\nThe plot is pretty much what we expect  :  The big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing New York City  , and it \'s   up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped  , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down .   ^\n\nThe script  , however  , is painfully bad .   ^\n\nIt \'s   fraught with lines so corny  , they do n\'t   even belong in B-movies  , and includes many character actions which make you think  ,  \" You idiot  ,  \" or  \" You stupid girl .  \"  ^\n\nI suppose when you \'ve   got a movie with a giant lizard loose in New York  , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well .   ^\n\nWhy is it that Godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them  , but is conveniently able to leap atop others  ?   ^\n\nWhy do helicopters have to follow Godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him  , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line  ?   ^\n\nWhy do sidewinder missiles  , which have small explosive warheads  , blow up entire buildings when they miss Godzilla  ?   ^\n\nWhy is a mission to bomb Madison Square Garden carried out by three F-18 fighter-bombers  , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two  ?   ^\n\nOkay  , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky  , but hey  , I was on a roll .  ^\n\nBroderick is usually a good actor  , but in this film he \'s   weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way .   ^\n\nHank Azaria does what he can  , but do n\'t   expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in THE BIRDCAGE .   ^\n\nLike Broderick \'s    , Azaria \'s   character is quite simply lacking in color .   ^\n\nWhat really annoyed me was Maria Pitillo  , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting .  ^\n\nCasting must have been asleep on this one .  ^\n\nThe one bright spot here is Jean Reno  , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic  , quite unlike what we \'ve   seem him do in the past .   ^\n\nAlthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster  , Reno brings a style to the role of Phillipe which makes him enjoyable .   ^\n\nUnfortunately  , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities .  ^\n\nThe entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek  , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it .   ^\n\nThis results in a significant amount of parody  , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster  , and ends up just producing a mess .  ^\n\nMost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief  , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously .   ^\n\nAlthough Emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture  , what good is it to sink millions into a CGI creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens  ?   ^\n\nIf we ca n\'t   take the characters seriously  , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply do n\'t   care what happens to them .  ^\n\nGODZILLA simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be .   ^\n\nFar be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters  , but here \'s   a behemoth running through the city  !   ^\n\nThere \'s   bound to be a lot of casualties  , but instead  GODZILLA is afflicted with the after-school G.I. Joe cartoon syndrome  , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm \'s   way just in time .   ^\n\nIn a couple of scenes  , Godzilla briefly breathes fire .   ^\n\nNone of the characters even remark upon this ability  , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers .   ^\n\nIt \'s   as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes  , Godzilla can do this  , just like in the old movie .   ^\n\nConsider another punch pulled .   ^\n\nThrough creative script writing  , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie  , but the final scene in this one does n\'t   just leave the door open  , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where GODZILLA II is waiting patiently .   ^\n\nIt made me want to gag .  ^\n\nEmmerich should have done away with 90  \% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film .   ^\n\nWith an intelligently written screenplay  , GODZILLA could have been so much more .   ^\n\nHowever  , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies  , the movie ends up being something that just does n\'t   work .   ^\n\nNow if they only had Raymond Burr   ... .

cv086_19488.txt,'Lucas was wise to start his Star Wars trilogy with Episode 4  : Episode 1 is a boring  , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects .  ^\n\nAfter the familiar \' A long time ago   .... \' opening  , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every Star Wars movie and computer game .  ^\n\nThe plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of Naboo  , ruled by Queen Amidala ( Portman  ) Jedi Knights Qui-Gon ( Neeson  ) and Obi Wan ( McGregor  ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade .  ^\n\nHowever  , this simple blockade is not all it seems  , and the Jedi Knights soon have to deal with many more dangers  , including facing the evil Darth Maul ( Ray Park .  )  ^\n\nThey also meet the future Darth Vadar  , Anakin Skywalker ( Jake Lloyd  ) Star Wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking  : script  , direction and characters .  ^\n\nThe script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic .  ^\n\nThe trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star  , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent .  ^\n\nThere \'s   no underlying tension  , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is .  ^\n\nThe film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story  , which does n\'t   help .  ^\n\nThere \'s   no snap to make the film work  , it moves at a plod .  ^\n\nThe script is boring  : all the characters speak in morals  , especially Anakins mother .  ^\n\nThere \'s   no group spirit evident here  , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders  , it \'s   evident that not much is going to happen .  ^\n\nThe two leads are hideously boring  , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it .  ^\n\nQui-Gon and Obi-Wan hold no presence on film  , and give little for the audience to root for .  ^\n\nThe audience will probably warm more to bad guy Darth Maul  , if he had been given more screen time .  ^\n\nMaul is one of the most underused bad guys in  film history  , even if he does provide the only \' straight \' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy .  )  ^\n\nAnakin is annoying and unlikeable.  , instead of cute and huggable as Lucas no doubt intended .  ^\n\nIt \'s   probably not surprising that his hateful little boy  , unfortunately blessed \' Ani \' by everyone he knows  , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible .  ^\n\nThe comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly Jar Jar Brinks  , although in the end none is provided in the film by him .  ^\n\nAlthough his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys  , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny .  ^\n\nThe only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a \' pod \' racer  , because I knew he would n\'t   be able to talk for a while .  ^\n\nQueen Amidala is a nothing in the film  , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must \' serve her people  , \' and go goo-goo over Anakin .  ^\n\nAgain  , her role will become more important in the later episodes  , and is given little to do here .  ^\n\nThe actors do n\'t   help the movie much either .  ^\n\nLiam Neeson seems bored and embarrassed  , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible .  ^\n\nMcGregor comes across as a posh mothers boy  , with little charm .  ^\n\nThe casting director must have chose him because he \'s   Scottish like Alec Guinness  : there \'s   little other explanation for it .  ^\n\nNatalie Portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script  , but she delivers a spunky performance .  ^\n\nAnd Jake Lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice .  ^\n\nThere \'s   very little talent evident with him  , it \'s   hard to see why Lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there .  ^\n\nHe \'s   not even very \' cute . \'  ^\n\nThe main claim of the film  , the special effects  , are okay .  ^\n\nThere \'s   nothing impressive about them  , yet they complement the story well .  ^\n\nThe CGI takes away much of the human element  , however .  ^\n\nThe battle droids for example  , the replacement for the stormtroopers  , are characterless little computer graphics  , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers .  ^\n\nEpisode 1 is just disappointing .  ^\n\nIt \'s   got high production values  , but little else .  ^\n\nThe music is meandering  , except near the end .  ^\n\nThe plot gives us no-one to root for  , or even care for .  ^\n\nThe effects are nice  , but dull .  ^\n\nThe plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should .  ^\n\nThere \'s   an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair  , and many clichs are catered for throughout the film .  ^\n\nApart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence  , Episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose  , except to make money and to get us to watch Episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film .  ^\n\nDisappointing is barely the word .

   the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we \'ve  been waiting an hour    and a half for .    ^\n\nStill ,  it \'s   entertaining  right up to the end ; certainly Barrymore \'s     incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the    silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the    Falwells , Bakkers , and Robertses of the religious worlds .    ^\n\nThis is an animated film from Czechoslovakia that is definitely NOT for    kids .^\n\nIt tells the old folk tale of the Pied Piper with a twist ending I    find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it .   ^\n\nPerhaps  economic  content is a better word -- it certainly does n\'t  show    capitalism in a good light .^\n\nNor human nature , nor anything else , for that    matter .^\n\nAs you may have guessed , this is not a TGIF film ; this is the kind    of film you are glad is over .^\n\nNot that it was n\'t  interesting for technical    reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done .^\n\nAll the puppets have    been carefully carved out of walnuts -- except for the animated stuffed rats .   ^\n\nBoy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , does n\'t  it ?^\n\nAdd onto that set design    that makes THE CABINET OF DOCTOR CALIGARI absolutely cheerful in comparison ,    and  you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally    unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night .^\n\nSome gore .    ^\n\nDo n\'t  bring children to this one .^\n\nDo n\'t  bring adults to this one , unless    they \'re  fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy    seeing wooden puppets raped .^\n\nBlech .    ^\n\nThis film takes us back and forth over the East German/West German border    with Meier , an East German wallpaperer whose father in the West dies and    leaves him a good deal of money .^\n\nHis uncle ( also in the West ) sneaks Meier    out of the country , unknown to the East Germans .^\n\nMeier , however , is less    than thrilled --  his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all    exist in East Germany .^\n\nAfter a round-the-world trip ( his boss think \'s  he \'s     on leave in Bulgaria ) , Meier starts visiting East Germany on day visas with    a fake ID , and uses his money and his connections to the West to buy his    girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew \'s  work -- while everyone    think \'s  he \'s  still living in East Germany .    ^\n\nOf course , something goes wrong -- and the ending is very funny , but it takes    the film too long to get there .^\n\nThe humor is spread too thin , and much of    the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) .^\n\nStill , a good concept for the    comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny .    ^\n\nAfter a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the    Seattle International Film Festival , I \'ve  learned several rules which , while    not absolute , should certainly be given deference to :     1 ) Be wary of French Comedies .^\n\nThese people like Jerry Lewis .    ^\n\n2 ) Ken Russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait .    ^\n\n3 ) Any film where SIFF Associate Director Gary Tucker refers to the lead as    \" old pouty-lips \" is probably not worth watching .    ^\n\n4 ) When an Australian film only awards credit is Best Cinematography , watch    out !^\n\nAustralia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since Weir and    Miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to    be a difficult ( not impossible -- witness MALCOLM last year ) task .    ^\n\nWell , I ignored rules&last night , and sat through a film that should be in    the Golden Turkey Awards .^\n\nIt \'s  as if the director was trying to do one of    those classic romance stories that were done in the 30\'s  about tragedy among    the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses .   ^\n\nLots and lots of horses .^\n\nThe film opens with a stallion mounting a mare    under  the  direction  of  Her Ladyship , which I guess is some kind of    foreshadowing , because the Missus of the house wants to have her son produce    an heir .^\n\nUnfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very    worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident .   ^\n\nHighlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor \'s  daughter , who has    the  hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender    kissing with a window between them ( while it \'s  raining -- you \'d  think a woman    studying medicine would know better ) .^\n\nThe photography IS good , but I kept    wishing for B&W -- everything seems sepia-colored anyway .^\n\nActually , I wished I    was watching SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA instead , but that \'s  life .    ^\n\nGrade : Z. Avoid like the plague , unless you \'re  looking for inadvertent yuks . '

) with the idea    that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that    country .^\n\nEverything about this proposed action smacks of Vietnam , with this    scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more    futile result than the other war .    ^\n\nThe film \'s  mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and    finding  it  acceptable by the public , something that should have been    accepted someyears ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but    one that is better received late than never .^\n\nThere has to be some common    sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate    the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether .    ^\n\nThe film opens in a quaint Cornish seaside village at the funeral of the    husband of a middle-aged woman , Grace ( Brenda Blethyn ) , who fell out of an    airplane , evidently committing suicide .^\n\nThe widow soon finds out her husband    was a bigger bastard than she imagined .^\n\nHe left her with a stack of enormous    bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old    house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second    mortgage .^\n\nThe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to    pay back her husband \'s  enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house    and becoming homeless .^\n\nShe also knows that he was having an affair with a    sophisticated woman from London , Honey ( Quick ) .^\n\nWhat makes the affair doubly    unsatisfying , is that when conferring with Honey , she finds out that he was    a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her .    ^\n\nEven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can ,    the creditors swoop down on her like vultures .^\n\nHer gardener and handyman ,    Matthew ( Ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check    bouncing .^\n\nSince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to    help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use .^\n\nThe two    soon  see  this as a possibly big business opportunity , as Grace works    miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff .^\n\nFor Grace ,    this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the Scotsman ,    Matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful    village  and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend Nicky    ( Valerie ) .    ^\n\nThe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police    sergeant ( Campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in Grace \'s     greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( Phillips ) counsels about the wisdom    of not taking action over something that you ca n\'t  control , and the doctor    ( Clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation .    ^\n\nThe story becomes incredulous when Grace decides to go to London and score    with a big-time drug dealer instead of having Matthew go , because she finds    out Nicky is pregnant and does n\'t  want Matthew to end up in jail .^\n\nIt is    interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only    that one can go to jail .    ^\n\nThe scene with Grace on Portobello Road in the Notting Hill section of    London , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white    dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in Cornwall but not on the    streets of Notting Hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely    hokey  and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never    recovered its dignity .    ^\n\nThe film moves into the formula mode , whereas Grace beats the odds against    her  failing  to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a    Frenchman ( Tcheky Karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her    fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a    millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences ,    thereby becoming a celebrity .^\n\nThings work out in a ridiculous way , where    there is a total breakdown in the character development of Grace , where this    matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live    flesh and blood .^\n\nThere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the    film has just enough of an acting performance by Brenda Blethyn to breathe    air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its    transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good    that the sweet old lady succeeded .^\n\nThis \'unhip\' film leaves one with the    impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as    something  naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former    husbands must do in order not to remain destitute .^\n\nUmmm !

cv098_17021.txt,'Starring Tony Danza  , Michael Madsen  \" Love to Kill  \" starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes .   ^\n\nAt the outset  , the movie appears to be about Tony Danza  , who \'s   an illegal distributor of guns  , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman .   ^\n\nDanza sets up a double date with her  , her sister  , and a collegue of his .   ^\n\nEverything seems to be going well  , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs .   ^\n\nMuch confusion and mahem ensues  , as the death is covered up and other associates of Danza \'s   begin to emerge  , all after one thing or another .   ^\n\nSound confusing  ?   ^\n\nIt is .   ^\n\nI think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity .   ^\n\nIn some respects  , it works .   ^\n\nBut the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess .   ^\n\nCharacters keep popping up with no explanation  , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen .   ^\n\nThe only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between Danza and the dead woman \'s   sister .   ^\n\nBut so little time is devoted to this part of the story  , we never really become too familiar with these characters  , and because of this  , we do n\'t   really care what happens to them .   ^\n\nWell  , I did n\'t    , at least .   ^\n\nOne thing I will give the movie is that it \'s   a complete departure for Tony Danza .   ^\n\nHere \'s   a guy  , because of his many sitcom roles  , who \'s   ingrained in  the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing .   ^\n\nHere  , he plays a man who \'s   just looking out for himself  , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin  , so be it .   ^\n\nI was very impressed by his performance  , and within minutes of the start of the film  , I had forgotten all about his good-guy persona .   ^\n\nMichael Madsen is also good as an associate of Danza \'s   who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him .   ^\n\nLike I said  , it \'s   not exactly a linear storyline .  ^\n\n\" Love to Kill  \" should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre  , but it \'s   just too bad that the story does n\'t   really add up to much .   ^\n\nThe stars deserved better  , and so did the audience  .'

cv100_12406.txt,'Deep Impact  ^\n\nDEEP IMPACT begins the official summer movie season  , and it also brings back memories of 1997 .   ^\n\nRemember when DANTE \'S   PEAK came out in February  ?   ^\n\nA few months later  , VOLCANO was released .   ^\n\nThe first film was smart  , exhilirating  , and one of the best disaster films I had ever seen .   ^\n\nThe latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent .   ^\n\nWell  , it \'s   deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition .   ^\n\nThis time  , unfortunately  , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from ARMAGEDDON  , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of July .  ^\n\nOf course  , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine  , and so I am in the minority  , as I was when I stood on the side of DANTE \'S   PEAK .   ^\n\nBut while watching DEEP IMPACT  , I began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film .   ^\n\nApparently many did  , and it utterly baffles me .  ^\n\nTo be completely honest  , I have n\'t   had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life .   ^\n\nVOLCANO had implausibilities up the wazoo  , but it was still rather fun to watch .   ^\n\nDEEP IMPACT does n\'t   just have implausibilities  , it also contains cheap human drama  , incredibly horrible special effects  , and a poorly constructed plot .   ^\n\nThe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters .  ^\n\nDEEP IMPACT begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies  ; advanced technology sets it in the future  , but FIRE IN THE SKY is showing on a local movie theater  , pushing it back to 1993  ) .   ^\n\nA line of students is outside at night  , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above .   ^\n\nAmong these are Leo Biederman ( Elijah Wood  ) and Sarah Hotchner ( Leelee Sobieski  ) .   ^\n\nLeo unknowingly discovers a comet  , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer  , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds .   ^\n\nHe races off to mail the information  , but is killed in a reckless car accident .   ^\n\nA year passes  , and nothing is heard about it again .  ^\n\nWe are then introduced to Jenny Lerner ( Ta Leoni  )  , a reporter for MSNBC .   ^\n\nShe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving Senator Alan Rittenhouse ( James Cromwell  ) .   ^\n\nShe talks to a woman who mentions that Rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named Ellie .   ^\n\nAfter talking with Rittenhouse  , and unsatisfied with the information she gets  , she decides to use the Internet for help .   ^\n\nLuckily  , she knows exactly how to spell the certain  \" Ellie  \" that she is looking for ( they spell it ELE in the film   ... that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled  ) .   ^\n\nBefore she can use the information  , the government decides to push her car off the road .   ^\n\nThey take her in to meet the President of the United States  , President Beck ( Morgan Freeman  ) .  ^\n\nBeck recommends that Jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference .   ^\n\nNaturally  , she wants to be compensated  , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question .  ^\n\nAnd so  , yada yada yada  , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans  : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive .   ^\n\nThey announce a plan called  \" ARK  ,  \" which is their only hope for survival .   ^\n\nA computer will select 800,000 people at random .   ^\n\nThese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet wo n\'t   kill off the entire human race .   ^\n\nAfter two years  , the dust will settle ( actually  , it would take much  , much longer --  approximately ninety years  , from what I understand  ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over .   ^\n\nThe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures  , but there is one subplot worth mentioning .   ^\n\nJenny and her father  , Jason ( Maximilian Schell  )  , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom .   ^\n\nThe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional .   ^\n\nIt \'s   a shame that nothing else is heartfelt .   ^\n\nNow  , of course  , we all know that the comet does impact the surface .   ^\n\nThe title alone suggests it  , and the previews actually show it  !   ^\n\nBy doing this  , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it wo n\'t   work .  ^\n\nDirector Mimi Leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show  \" ER .  \"   ^\n\nHer major film debut was THE PEACEMAKER  , a pathetic and heartless action film .   ^\n\nWell  , this time Leder outdid herself  , creating a film worse than that one .   ^\n\nSuggestion to Ms. Leder  : Please  , stay away from the big screen  , or at least the action genre .   ^\n\nMuch of the blame can be placed on Leder directly  , because the pace is disastrously off .   ^\n\nThroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours  ) .   ^\n\nIt literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time --  it \'s   that boring .   ^\n\nOf course  , Leder is n\'t   all to blame for it .   ^\n\nScreenwriters Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time .   ^\n\nWhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway  ) .   ^\n\nChock full of cheesy one liners (  \" You know  , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school  !  \"  ) and stupid characters  , you might think we were back in the 70s again .   ^\n\nOnly one of the subplots is remotely interesting  , while the rest are forgettable and boring .  ^\n\nAnd the main plot is so outrageous that you ca n\'t   figure out if this film is supposed to be an action  , drama  , or sci-fi .  ^\n\nTo put it simply  : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation .   ^\n\nThat \'s   right  , 80  \% miss  , and 20  \% hit .   ^\n\nScenes above the Earth are well done  , and the orbiting ship is majestic .   ^\n\nBut the comet is a huge mistake  , making it more laughable than frightening .   ^\n\nThe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough  , but that \'s   forgiveable .   ^\n\nWhat is n\'t   forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface .   ^\n\nGive me a break  , will ya  ?   ^\n\nAnd of course  , the much hyped collision of comet and Earth .   ^\n\nWell  , it is far from spectacular  , and it makes INDEPENDENCE DAY look brilliant .   ^\n\nThe water rushing towards the land is effective  , but once it hits the continent  , the effects turn ridiculous .   ^\n\nCGI water is used  , and it looks so bad that I heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks .   ^\n\nIn fact  , I may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days .  ^\n\nJust when we think visual effects ca n\'t   be improved  , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be .  ^\n\nOne thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning Mimi Leder \'s   direction  , which also influences the actors .   ^\n\nLeder loves to show the actors  \' faces before and during moments of terror .   ^\n\nThis reminded me of another action director  , Renny Harlin ( DIE HARD 2  , CLIFFHANGER  ) .   ^\n\nBut Harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations .   ^\n\nLeder likes to flaunt people \'s   fears via their faces  , but instead of coming off as sympathetic  , Leder seems more of a Sadist .   ^\n\nOne moment has an astronaut flying off into space .  ^\n\nThis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience  , but Leder wants to go farther and shows us the person \'s   face while drifting into space .   ^\n\nThis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience  , and I  , for one  , am not going to be fooled .   ^\n\nOn another note  , Leder \'s   film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts .  ^\n\nThe pace does pick up  , and some very emotional moments are shown .   ^\n\nThen again  , when you watch people cry for their loved ones  , it \'s   obvious it will be emotional .   ^\n\nIt \'s   mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into  \" feeling  \" for the characters  , but it did n\'t   work for me .  ^\n\nBut anyway  , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given .   ^\n\nTa Leoni ( BAD BOYS  , TV \'s    \" The Naked Truth  \"  ) is the best of the film  , and she is given the meatiest role .   ^\n\nHer character is made stronger by Leoni \'s   presence  , and we grow to care for her .   ^\n\nRobert Duvall is energetic and fun to watch  , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot .   ^\n\nElijah Wood also comes off rather successfully  , but he still has n\'t   had many good roles ( Wood  , stick to drama  !   ^\n\nYou are too talented for this stuff  ) .   ^\n\nVanessa Redgrave is barely acknowledgeable  , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen .   ^\n\nMaximilian Schell is distracting  , but he does provide some nice humor .  ^\n\nMorgan Freeman has been infinitely better than this  , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him  ) .   ^\n\nLeelee Sobieski could have been better  , but I think she just suffered from a poorly written character .   ^\n\nA special note should go to Ron Eldard and Denise Crosby .  ^\n\nEldard is good in his role  , but is limited by the plot .   ^\n\nCrosby is special to me personally because she was Tasha Yar from TV \'s    \" Star Trek  : The Next Generation .  \"   ^\n\nSeeing her was one of the highlights of the film .   ^\n\nOverall  , a very talented cast virtually wasted .  ^\n\nDEEP IMPACT is rated PG-13 for disaster related elements and brief language .  ^\n\nThis is one of the worst films of the year  , and if it is any omen of things to come  , this summer could be one of the worst ever .   ^\n\nLuckily  , THE X-FILES MOVIE is coming up  , and hopefully ARMAGEDDON will be more successful .   ^\n\nIt \'s   a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just is n\'t   worth much .   ^\n\nCosting nearly $ 75 million  , with special effects done by the illustrious ILM ( which is a huge shocker  )  , and with a score composed by Oscar-winner James Horner ( TITANIC  )  , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience .   ^\n\nWell  , it \'s   not .   ^\n\nWhen the comet does hit the Earth  , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it  .'

Windon from THE POSTMAN uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl \'s   face .       ^\n\nOur show \'s   two heroes  , the crew \'s   chief  , Wynt Perkins  , played laconically by Scott Glenn  , and his second-in-command  , Jesse Graves  , played by Howie Long in a weak attempt to be the next Steven Seagal  , enter the burning house looking for the little girl .   ^\n\nIn a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames .  ^\n\nThe manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse .       ^\n\nThis mawkish show cuts back to Monica  , who has a life-or-death decision to make .   ^\n\nThe chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group .   ^\n\nWill it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and Monica \'s   two firefighting buddies  ?  ^\n\nShe has only seconds to decide who will be saved .   ^\n\nYes  , she goes for the majority  , but  , miracle of miracles  , the other three come out alive anyway .       ^\n\nNot content with a traditional firefighting story  , Chris Soth \'s   screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having William Forsythe from PALOOKAVILLE play a vicious killer named Randy Earl Shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape .  ^\n\n(  \" Hoods in the woods  ,  \" is what the  \" ground-pounders  \" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire .  )   ^\n\nAlong the way  , Shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by Suzy Amis  , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father  , who was a Marine drill instructor .       ^\n\nMost of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor Howie Long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing .   ^\n\nHe flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck .   ^\n\nArguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside .   ^\n\nUsing a ramp  , he shoots straight out of the top of the building \'s   attic  , and when he hits the ground  , he just rides off in a cloud of dust .       ^\n\nWhen the film is n\'t   using some stock footage of actual forest fires  , the simulated ones look hokey .   ^\n\nEditor Jack Hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions .       ^\n\nThe ending  , with its sick twists  , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie .   ^\n\nPerhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise I heard afterwards in the lobby  ,  \" It \'s   not as bad as some of the television sitcoms .  \"       ^\n\nFIRESTORM runs mercifully just 1:29 .   ^\n\nIt is rated R for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers  .'
cv102_8306.txt,'Ever since WARGAMES  , the first real computer hacking movie  , Hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking .   ^\n\nThese films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous .   ^\n\nIf it \'s   not this  , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect .  ^\n\nHACKERS is guilty of all of these crimes .   ^\n\nTo anyone familiar with computers and/or the Internet  , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you ca n\'t   take it anymore .   ^\n\nThose of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the World Wide Web  , the Internet Movie Database  , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled  \" Goofs  \" .   ^\n\nThis is the section for mistakes in the movies .   ^\n\nWell  , IMDb sums up HACKERS extremely well with the first goof listed  :  \" Generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology  \" .   ^\n\nAnd truthfully  , this is one-hundred percent correct .  ^\n\nThe plot  , obviously  , centers around computer hacking .   ^\n\nMore specifically  , it follows the exploits of Dade Murphy  , a young computer hacker played by Jonny Lee Miller .   ^\n\nMiller should be extremely thankful for the film TRAINSPOTTING  , because if it were not for that  , who knows where his career would be now after HACKERS .   ^\n\nThe film opens with a young Dade Murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems .   ^\n\nHe was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old .   ^\n\nThe film then picks up at that point  , an eighteen year old Dade Murphy hacking away at the computer .  ^\n\nDade later meets up with fellow hackers Acid Burn ( Angelina Jolie  )  , Cereal Killer ( Matthew Lillard  )  , Lord Nikon ( Laurence Mason  )  , and the Phantom Phreak ( Renoly Santiago  )  , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible  : hack the Gibson computer and not get caught by the FBI .   ^\n\nOh  , and as a little sub-plot  , Dade also tries to woo Acid Burn  , the only female hacker in the film .  ^\n\nReally  , I ca n\'t   think of much more to say about the film \'s   plot aside from what I \'ve   said .   ^\n\nIt \'s   just a bunch of computer geeks ( no  , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality  ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the FBI .   ^\n\nThanks to this movie  , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do .   ^\n\nThis movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time  , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list .   ^\n\nTo sum it up  , HACKERS is a terrible computer film .   ^\n\nIf you \'re   looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world  , I suggest SNEAKERS .   ^\n\nAlthough at times it too may seem a little far fetched  , it should be much more believable than HACKERS to regular computer users .  ^\n\nHopefully  , this film did n\'t   influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time  .'
cv103_11943.txt,'If there \'s   one thing I just ca n\'t   stand  , it \'s   a film that oozes with sentimentality .   ^\n\nHere \'s   a note to all film makers  :  films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves .   ^\n\nSwelling  , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy  , and that the situation is hopeless .   ^\n\nAlas  , My Giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that I forgot as I watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up .  ^\n\nWhat reminded me was that I was n\'t   choked up  , or even the slightest bit moved  , for that matter .   ^\n\nMy Giant is a forced  , contrived  , and conspicuously un-cute ( I detest the word  \" cute  \" but I \'ve   chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a  \" cute  \" film here  ) .   ^\n\nIt takes a premise that might have been interesting ( I liked the preview  )  , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches  , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience .   ^\n\nMaybe it will work for some people .   ^\n\nIt did n\'t   work for me .  ^\n\nBilly Crystal plays Sam Cayman  , an agent who  , at the beginning of the film  , is in Romania .   ^\n\nHe \'s   in Romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film .   ^\n\nThe screenplay has him in Romania so he can get fired  , get in a car accident  , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall .   ^\n\nHis name is Max ( Gheorghe Muresan  )  , and Sam thinks he \'d   be a great movie star because of his size .  ^\n\nSubplots are as follows  :  Sam has a son and a wife ( Kathleen Quinlan  )  , and he \'s   never around for them  , so they move to Chicago .   ^\n\nMax is in love with a woman named Lilianna who moved away from Romania twenty years before the film begins .   ^\n\nSam convinces Max to go back to America with him so they can make lots of money  , and so their various subplots can all be resolved .   ^\n\nSam is broke .   ^\n\nMax is dying .   ^\n\nPass the kleenex .  ^\n\nMy Giant  , as a comedy  , is only moderately funny .   ^\n\nIt has its moments  , the best of which features Steven Seagal making fun of himself .   ^\n\nIn one great scene  , Sam gets his son on the phone to talk to Seagal  ; of course  , his son does n\'t   believe that he \'s   actually speaking to Seagal  , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( I would quote the line I like but it would probably lose its effect  ) .    ^\n\nCrystal is always entertaining  , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely  )  ; often  , however  , he \'s   countered by a slew of jokes that are n\'t   funny  , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes .   ^\n\nMuresan is kind of fun to watch  , but he just ca n\'t   act very well .   ^\n\nQuinlan  , on the other hand  , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents .   ^\n\nShe was underused last year in both Event Horizon and Breakdown  , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff .   ^\n\nHere  , the best thing she gets to do is fake a Romanian accent .  ^\n\nAll of these disappointing ingredients create a film that  , for much of its running time  , is simply mediocre .   ^\n\nAs My Giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion  , however  , director Michael Lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated Hudson Hawk  ) and scriptwriter David Seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable  , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings .   ^\n\nSam \'s   multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family  ?  ) .   ^\n\nLater  , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying Sam \'s   reunion with his family .   ^\n\nAnd some people might think that what Sam does for Max towards the end is a valiant thing  , but I had a few morality problems with it ( and I apologize for being vague  ) .  ^\n\nIt \'s   icky .   ^\n\nIt drips with gooey  , wannabe human emotions .   ^\n\nMy Giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film .   ^\n\nMore importantly  , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is .   ^\n\nInstead  , it \'s   a complicated  , overlong  , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears .   ^\n\nAnd since it left me feeling completely unmoved  , I stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world  .'

cv106_18379.txt,'IN THE LINE OF DUTY is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in USA .  ^\n\nTHE TWILIGHT MURDERS  , another one from the series  , is dealing with the case of Gordon Kahl ( played by Rod Steiger  )  , old farmer from North Dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised U.S. government .  ^\n\nAfter being released  , he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest .  ^\n\nWhen the U.S. marshals come to arrest him  , it turns out that Kahl is n\'t   alone .  ^\n\nMany poor farmers in rural Northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs  , and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that .  ^\n\nThat brings FBI on the scene  , and Agent Mayberly ( Michael Gross  ) is supervising the manhunt .  ^\n\nHowever  , his efforts seem fruitless  , since Kahl still has many supporters  , some of them even in the local law enforcement .  ^\n\nAfter BETRAYED  , 1988 thriller by Costa Gavras  , Hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing extremism in the American Northwest  , and that remained so until Oklahoma City bombing  , when media hype brought right-wingers back into spotlight .  ^\n\nUntil that time  , only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , THE TWILIGHT MURDERS is still routine and formulaic television film  , that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script .  ^\n\nSometimes  , like many American TV movies  , it creates drama where drama should n\'t   be .  ^\n\nOn the other hand  , film is steadily directed by Dick Lowry  , and Rod Steiger does good job potraying Gordon Kahl .  ^\n\nOn the other hand  , Michael Gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible .  ^\n\nHowever  , film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and political issues  , so hour and half spent in front of the screen should n\'t   be the total waste of time .

 )  , 5 trailers  , 3 TV spots  , talent bios  , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie  )  , and assorted still galleries .    ^\n\nThe transfer on this International version is incredible   ... you \'d   think you were watching a new release .   ^\n\nImages are sharp  , colors jump off the screen  , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts .   ^\n\nOnly some special effects sequences show the wear of time  , and there just is n\'t   much that can be done about that ( unless you \'re   obsessive like George Lucas  ) .   ^\n\nThe new THX approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places  , however you \'ll   be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre Jerry Goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to John Williams  \' classic Superman theme and sounds better suited for a Cannon Films  \' Golan-Globus production  ) .   ^\n\nThe commentary track featuring director Szwarc and project consultant Bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries .   ^\n\nBosco seems to be an expert in all things Supergirl and is there with Szwarc to ensure that there \'s   no dead air on the track .   ^\n\nBosco probes Szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen  , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation .   ^\n\nAlthough  , at times you can tell that Bosco is looking for a specific response from Szwarc  , and is surprised when he does n\'t   get that response .   ^\n\nWe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track  , most notably the  \" almost  \" appearance in the film by Christopher Reeve .   ^\n\nGreat detail is given about Superman \'s   proposed role in the original script before Reeve ( wisely  ) dropped out .   ^\n\nAs it stands  , Superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission .   ^\n\nFor the sake of brevity  , I wo n\'t   even get into that one .   ^\n\nSzwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the Salkinds ( and everyone else agreed  ) that Supergirl needed to stand on its own  , replacing the science fiction of the Superman films with cutsy  \" whimsical fantasy  \" nonsense .   ^\n\nBosco also points out scenes not in the American release as they come along  , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office .   ^\n\nAgain  , for the sake of brevity  , I wo n\'t   even get into that one .   ^\n\nAnchor Bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50,000 copies pressed  ) two-disc set .   ^\n\nDisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release .   ^\n\nDisc two features the never before seen director \'s   cut of the film  , which runs 138 minutes long .   ^\n\nThe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which do n\'t   add much of note  , except for a few moments which lengthen Peter O\'Toole \'s   screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances  ) .   ^\n\nThe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono  , but fans of the film wo n\'t   care .   ^\n\nOne question though   ... should n\'t   the director \'s   commentary be on the director \'s   cut of the film  ?   ^\n\nI \'d   never seen Supergirl before I sat down to watch this DVD .   ^\n\nI was nine when it was released to theaters  , and even then I was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it .   ^\n\nSo when I popped the DVD into my player and sat down in my easy chair I had no idea what to expect .   ^\n\nI knew the film was n\'t   beloved and I never had any interest in it before  , but I was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc .   ^\n\nAs the disc began to spin I was rather impressed with the opening sequence  , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong .   ^\n\nCome to find out however it was just the Chase Digital Stereo logo   ... so I slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started .   ^\n\nAt the end of the film  , Supergirl flies back into the lake with the Omegahedron  , and FLIES back to Argo City .   ^\n\nUgh  , I give up .   ^\n\nI \'m   surprised I even made it to the end of the film not once  , not twice  , but THREE times to review these discs .   ^\n\nSupergirl is definitely a terrific DVD package  , but a very lousy movie .

cv111_12253.txt,'I was incredulous when I first heard that MGM was planning a sequel    to their 1995 science-fiction flick SPECIES .   ^\n\nSquandering an    intriguing premise  , the original film turned out to be a dreadful    mess  , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike --   and    nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success  ,    raking in over $ 60 million domestic during the competitive summer    season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( Ben    Kingsley \'s   a splendid actor  , but a marquee name he ai n\'t    ) .     ^\n\nMiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film  , I doubted that    they \'d   dare tempt fate and go for another round .     ^\n\nSo here comes SPECIES II  , with a new creative team ( director Peter    Medak and screenwriter Chris Brancato step in for Roger Donaldson and    Dennis Feldman  , respectively  ) that fails to improve the series one    iota --   like its predecessor  , SPECIES II fails to capitalize on a    potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from    ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid .     ^\n\nThe film follows the exploits of a young man  , Patrick Ross ( Justin    Lazard  )  , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order    to pick up women  , loitering in strip clubs  , and generally trying to    bed as many different ladies as he possibly can .   ^\n\nIn other words  ,    Patrick is like a lot of guys  ; these activities could describe the    everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age  , but there \'s   a    catch --   he \'s   an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly    successful mission to Mars  , and who \'s   now infected with alien DNA .     ^\n\nPatrick \'s   overriding compulsion  : to mate and sire countless numbers    of gooey little alien offspring .   ^\n\nAnd when he becomes aware of Eve    ( Natasha Henstridge  )  , a half-human  , half-alien clone of the monster    from the first film being studied in a government lab  , Patrick \'s      primary focus turns to her --    \" if these two were to mate  , the    resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable  \" warns Dr.    Laura Baker ( Marg Helgenberger  , gamely reprising her role  ) with    admirable conviction .     ^\n\nSPECIES II opens with the Mars mission  , and the space scenes are    remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking  , even splicing back to    dated  , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities --   they really    skimped on production values this time around .   ^\n\nHowever  , this all    looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of    the evil alien goo which ultimately infests Patrick  ; watching as it    slinks around the command module of the spaceship  , any question as to    whether or not this is a cheesy B-movie is quickly answered .     ^\n\nMr. Brancato \'s   original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines    which often leaves the audience in stitches .   ^\n\nLike the first film    ( and perhaps in homage to it  )  , there \'s   a real penchant for dialogue    which underlines the obvious .   ^\n\nLast time around featured the    hootworthy line uttered by Forest Whitaker \'s   psychic empath character    upon entering a bloodsoaked room --    \" Something bad happened here .  \"     ^\n\nThis time  , Laura gets to stand over a fresh  , shredded corpse with its    entails ripped out and mutter  \" This is awful .  \"   ^\n\nAnd she \'s   not even    empathic  !     ^\n\nAnd when a psychotically horny Patrick accosts a supermarket shopper    and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a    woefully-paced suspense sequence  , Eve  , who \'s   telepathically linked to    her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever  )  , helpfully tells our    alien-hunting protagonists  ,  \" He \'s   going to rape her .  \"     ^\n\nWhile SPECIES II is often unintentionally hilarious  , at least it    occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own .   ^\n\nThere \'s   an    amusing  , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which does n\'t      really make much sense  , but I appreciated the sentiment  )  , as well as    some supermarket-related hijinx (  \" He \'s   in Aisle 1  !  \" informs Eve  ) .   ^\n\nIf    the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone  , it would have    been much more charming and enjoyable to watch  , but  , to its    detriment  , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and    barrels along to a bloody  , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion .     ^\n\nMuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense  , and there are    such gaping plot holes that it \'s   terribly difficult to contain any    suspension of disbelief .   ^\n\nThe implausibilities are endless  : what    about the toxic bomb in Eve \'s   brain  ?   ^\n\nWhy are the guards armed with    guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual  ?   ^\n\nMy favourite    was the slow-motion sequence in the film where Eve  , sporting    superhuman strength  , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting    to contain her with what look like body blocks .   ^\n\nThis is the sort of    movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief  ,    incredulous that it \'s   being foisted upon the public .     ^\n\nReturning headlines Michael Madsen ( who reprises tough guy Press    Lennox  ) and Ms. Helgenberger do what they can with this goofy    screenplay  , but there \'s   realistically only so much one can do with    this script as a basis .   ^\n\nMykelti Williamson ( portraying astronaut    Dennis Gamble  ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic    brash-mouthed character  , and fine character actors George Dzundza    ( playing Colonel Burgess and looking ridiculous in the process  ) and    James Cromwell ( Patrick \'s   neglectful father  , Senator Ross  ) are    utterly wasted in the film .   ^\n\nMr. Lazard gives his character an    appropriately shifty-eyed look  , while returning vixen Ms. Henstridge    is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits    herself nicely  )  , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar    role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all  ) .     ^\n\nMs. Henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have    expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the    SPECIES series  , claiming that  \" she \'s   so empowered .  \"   ^\n\nA lethal    half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque    fashion --   now *that\'s* what I call empowerment  .'
cv112_12178.txt,'The sequel to The Fugitive ( 1993  )  , U.S Marshals is an average thriller using it \'s   association with The Fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks .  ^\n\nTommy Lee Jones returns to his role as Chief Deputy Samuel Gerard  , the grizzly cop who was after Harrison Ford in The Fugitive .  ^\n\nThis time  , he \'s   after fugitive Mark Sheridan ( Snipes  ) who the police think killed two FBI agents  , but of course he \'s   been set up  , and when the police  plane escort he ( and Gerard  ) are riding crashes  , he makes a run for it  , Gerard not so hot on his tail .  ^\n\nWhat follows is about 2 hours of action  , brought to us by the director of Executive Decision ( 1995  )  , another film curiously involving a plane .  ^\n\nWhen comparing  this movie to The Fugitive  , the prequel is far superior .  ^\n\nBut even on it \'s   own  , U.S Marshals is a pretty lousy movie .  ^\n\nWhile the original was reasonably intelligent  , and had a fugitive to root for  , the audience feels strangely distanced from Snipes fugitive  , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film \'s   overlong running time .  ^\n\nWhile The Fugitive gave a little time to develop Harrison Fords character  , U.S Marshals is straight in there  , pulling it \'s   trump card ( the place crash  ) almost immediately .  ^\n\nTo be honest  , I could n\'t   care less if Snipe \'s   character got captured or not .  ^\n\nSnipes performance is average  , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive  ) for reasons I \'ll   explain later .  ^\n\nTommy Lee Jones is as fine as ever  , although his role is hardly a challenge .  ^\n\nThe sense of deja vu was overwhelming .  ^\n\nI know it \'s   the same role from The Fugitive  , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film .  ^\n\nThere \'s   a few \' nudge nudge \' references from the first film  , but apart from that  , nothing .  ^\n\nNobody even mentions Harrison Ford in this movie .  ^\n\nDowney Jnr is OK as FBI agent John Royce who \'s   roped into the chase  , and sexy french actress Irene Jacob wanders in and out of the movie as Snipes wife .  ^\n\nNobody looks as if their having a good time  , and all the performers are on autopilot .  ^\n\nThe supporting cast are O.K  , but when it comes to performances  , U.S Marshals falls flat on it \'s   face .  ^\n\nIt does n\'t   fare any better plot-wise  , either .  ^\n\nThe film starts off with Gerard trying to capture Snipes  , but then veers off into terrorists territory .  ^\n\nAs said above  , the film is an normal  , average terrorist thriller  , seen a million times before  , but is using The Fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional .  ^\n\nIf this film was n\'t   the \' sequel \' to The Fugitive  , this would probably go straight to video  , or not even been made at all  , because it \'s   so average .  ^\n\nAnd because of the film \'s   plot changing it \'s   course  , Snipes is almost forgotten apart  , and hardly features in the movie .  ^\n\nStuart Baird  , the director  , is all right  , but there \'s   no particular scene that stands out .  ^\n\nIt \'s   director is the usual action movie style .  ^\n\nEven the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension .  ^\n\nThe special effects are nice  , especially the plane crash  , and there \'s   a good ( if very loud  ) soundtrack by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith .  ^\n\nBut in the end  , U.S Marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement .  ^\n\nSure  , it \'s   loud and dumb  , but in the end U.S Marshals just ai n\'t   fun .  ^\n\nBored performers and a lackluster plot and script  , do not make a good action movie .

cv120_3793.txt,'Starting with THE LITTLE MERMAID and most recently THE LION KING, the Walt    Disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make    modern day animated classics, but were particularly in touch with what the    general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see.^\n\nTherefore , it \'s     with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies I was so    disappointed with POCAHONTAS .    ^\n\nDespite  some  innovation  and  risk taking , the story is surprisingly    straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters .^\n\nA    group of Englishmen lead by the evil Governor Ratcliffe come to the New    World in search of gold with no regard for the \" savages \" that live there .   ^\n\nThe natives look upon the English with just as much fear and distrust .^\n\nOnly    the love between the beautifully structured Pocahontas and the dashing    Captain John Smith can prevent a terrible clash .^\n\nThe ending , as it turns    out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film \'s  finer moments .    ^\n\nThe characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth .^\n\nGovernor    Ratcliffe ,  for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere    appearance is supposed to bring about hisses .^\n\nCaptain John Smith is a blond    hunk who , while \" slightly \" misguided , is good at heart .^\n\nPocahontas herself    is the typical Disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man    who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time .^\n\nShe    even comes complete with insignificant best friend .    ^\n\nAgain , against tradition , talking animals are n\'t  used , but a lusty , wizened ,    talking tree is .^\n\nThis is an odd compromise , but it \'s  one of the few elements    that really work .^\n\nThe animals are a delight , and what brief time their    interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland    presentation .^\n\nMaybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story    unfold through their eyes .^\n\nThe talking tree , who seems to have a thing for    John Smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is    perhaps the best developed of the bunch .    ^\n\nThe music , a welcome delight in the later Disney films , is mostly a let down    here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , \" Colors of the    Wind . \"^\n\nMel Gibson , as the voice of John Smith , has a solid singing voice and    should  have  been used more .^\n\nThe opposite holds true for the Governor    Ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic    character .    ^\n\nI was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected    running time .^\n\nEven the children in the audience seemed restless .^\n\nWhile    there \'s  no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want -- or Disney    wants them to -- most I believe will be disappointed .    ^\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem is that Disney has strayed from their familiar    fable  and  fairy  tale themes to history .^\n\nIt \'s  all right to change or    embellish fantasy to suit a movie \'s  entertainment value , but doing so to    historical facts does n\'t  work nearly as well as creating nagging questions    in  the  viewer \'s  minds and plot holes that are never filled .^\n\nEven the    artwork , another Disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any    story problems even more obvious .    ^\n\nAs mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while    viewing  the  film .^\n\nFor instance , if John Smith was truly such a world    traveler and had so much experience with \" savages , \" why did he so quickly    change his previous \" kill as many Indians as I can \" attitude .^\n\nIf he was such    a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this .^\n\nOr    how  about  Pocahontas \' amazing English speaking ability when this had    supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ?^\n\nI can understand    making the Native Americans speak English for the benefit of the audience ,    but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have    cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway .^\n\nAs it is , I    wonder if it does n\'t  give kids the wrong impression .    ^\n\nIn  short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much    romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set .^\n\nWhile Disney    tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions ,    they end up failing on too many levels .

cv122_7891.txt,'When respecting a director, you must also respect the fact that they are not    perfect.^\n\nWoody Allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he \'s  my    favorite .^\n\nEven Martin Scorsese has n\'t  had a perfect track record .^\n\nKevin    Smith , after a smashing debut with the classic \" Clerks \" stooped as low to    sell-out and make the dreadful \" Mallrats . \"^\n\nI mean , so far the only director    who \'s  made several films , none of which have been bad is Richard Linklater    ( \" Slacker , \" \" Dazed and Confused , \" \" Before Sunrise , \" and \" SubUrbia\" ... all    which were great ) .    ^\n\nNow , I ADORE Quentin Tarantino .^\n\nHis first two films were classic films , the    second one being one of the greatest films of all time .^\n\nBut 1995 just was n\'t     that  good  of a year for him .^\n\nHe made way too many TV appearances .^\n\nHe    mispronounced Jackie Chan \'s  name on the MTV Movie Awards .^\n\nAnd he made this    film . ^\n\n( He was also awarded an Oscar , so I guess that would be a grand    exception ) .^\n\nRobert Rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one ,    but a cool one .^\n\nI \'ve  never seen an Alexandre Rockwell or Allison Anders    film , so I ca n\'t  comment on them .^\n\nBut in this crap ensemble director \'s  film ,    all four give pitiful efforts .^\n\nPitiful for any director , too .    ^\n\nNow in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out .^\n\nI \'ve     never seen all of \" New York Stories , \" but have heard the first two films , by    Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola are crap ( I saw Woody \'s  one , which was    hilarious but not totally up to par ) .^\n\nBut I will rate each film individually    and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film .    ^\n\nEXPOSITION : A simple one - a bellhop , Ted ( the totally overdone Tim Roth ,    who \'s   a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good    moments ) is working on New Year \'s  Eve for his first shift (  ! ! ! ) in an old    fancy hotel .^\n\nHe \'s  the only one there ( again :  ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple    rooms  ( yet  again :  ! ! ! ) .^\n\nThe old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal Marc    Lawrence - who hated Pulp Fiction actually ) hands over his cap to Ted and he    goes to his job happily .^\n\nAs the night goes on , he becomes increasingly    annoyed and hostile .^\n\nYea .    ^\n\n( The short films are presented in order , btw ) :     THE MISSING INGREDIENT Writer/Director : Allison Anders Starring : Sammi    Davis , Amanda DeCadenet , Valeria Golino , Madonna , Ione Skye , Lili Taylor ,    Alicia Witt     This  one  starts  it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap    dialogue .^\n\nThe situation is so terrible that it \'s  physically painful to    watch .^\n\nThe plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to    bring back a godess who is ( GASP ! ) stuck inside some object in their hotel    room .^\n\nThe witch that was supposed to bring it ( Ione Skye ) calls up Ted and    asks him if she can perform Fellatio on him to get it .^\n\nYeah , that \'s  what I    said .^\n\nStupid plot , inane characters who are n\'t  interesting at all , etc , etc ,    etc. The only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it    wastes pitifully .^\n\nNot even actually funny for a second .    ^\n\nTHE WRONG MAN Writer/Director : Alexandre Rockwell Starring : David Proval ,    Jennifer Beals and Laurence Bender     Another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on .^\n\nTed stumbles    into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( David    Proval and Jennifer Beals in her attempt at \" coming back \" ) who are playing    sex games .^\n\nTed tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon .^\n\nBut    at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much .^\n\nAnd David    Proval  has  never overacted as much .^\n\nAnd it \'s  \" Pulp Fiction \" producer    Laurence Bender who gets to puke from a window .^\n\nA masterpiece compared to    the first one , but still  ...    ^\n\nTHE  MISBEHAVERS  Writer/Director :  Robert Rodriguez Starring : Antonio    Banderes , Tamlyn Tomita , Lana McKissack , Danny Verduzco , Salma Hayek     Would a Robert Rodriguez film be the same without Salma Hayek \'s  navel ?^\n\nNope .   ^\n\nLuckily she \'s  on the TV dancing so we get to see her .^\n\nSurprisingly enough ,    when I read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this    one seemed to have the most potential .^\n\nIt was fast-paced , funny , and well ,    funny .^\n\nBut when I watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to    gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once .^\n\nAntonio    overacts nicely and the two kids ( Lana and Danny ) are funny .^\n\nBut , as I said ,    it moves slowly and in that way , it \'s  more painful than funny .^\n\nBut the    ending was stupid and funny at the same time .^\n\nOh !^\n\nThe plot : Antonio is a    supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home    while he and his wife ( Tomita ) go out to get drunk at a New Year \'s  Party .   ^\n\nAntonio hires Ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but    things go wrong ... it was okay .    ^\n\nTHE MAN FROM HOLLYWOOD Writer/Director : Quentin Tarantino Starring : Quentin    Tarantino , Bruce Willis , Paul Calderon and Jennifer Beals ( again )     Ironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best    represents what Quentin has done with this film .^\n\nHe plays Chester , a spoiled    brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands    and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a Hitchcock TV    episode starring Steve McQueen and Peter Lorre where they gamble to see if    one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row .^\n\nThey \'re  drunk    and need sober but nervous Ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the    lighter does n\'t  light .^\n\nThey also pay him a lot of cash .^\n\nThis is so much    exactly  what  this little film is about that it \'s  campy .^\n\nTim Roth was    probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film    made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves \'cause they \'ve  had    hits , major or minor .^\n\nIt took Quentin to realize that .^\n\nBut the thing is , it    does n\'t  seem like he realizes that .^\n\nIf he did , I \'d  give this a goodstars .   ^\n\nBut this sucked .^\n\nIt was anti-climactic and the dialogue was n\'t  very good .^\n\nHe    starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes .^\n\nThat makes    no sense .^\n\nIt \'s  cool for a while , then he makes it uneven .^\n\nIt \'s  long and it \'s     just not very good .^\n\nHopefully Quentin never repeats what he did with this    one .    ^\n\nCONCLUSION : What \'s  the moral here ?^\n\nIf you \'ve  made celebrated films , do n\'t  do    an ensemble piece .^\n\nThey should have re-watched \" New York Stories \" and then    stopped in their tracks .^\n\nNone of these have any point to them and they \'re     embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors \'cause    they \'re   working with crap .^\n\nBut I will forgive everyone involved and I    especially look forward to Quentin \'s  next directing job ( even though he and    Rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool \" From Dusk Till    Dawn , \" which I found exhilerating ) .^\n\nI love Quentin and I suppose it \'s  good    he made \" The Man from Hollywood \" because it makes him seem more realistic    and not some \" God of Cinema . \"^\n\nI seem to respect directors if they are n\'t     \" Gods \"  and are actually human beings who make mistakes .^\n\n\" The Man from    Hollywood \"  is  his  big  mistake and let \'s  hope he does n\'t  return her    continuously .

ON THE BEACH , THE END OF THE    WORLD , DAMNATION ALLEY , THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR , and so on .    ^\n\nTo date , the most smoothly done were straightforward \" haircuts \" of the    classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects    the  widow  and  the  son against an evil organization , usually one in    possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining    claim .^\n\nMost of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like THE    VIRGINIAN and SHANE .^\n\n( My personal favorite is a Patrick Swayze movie called    STEEL DAWN , which was fairly well made on a small budget . )    ^\n\nNow we have WATERWORLD , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to    town to rescue the young widow and her daughter .^\n\n( Well , she \'s  not a widow ,    and the kid is n\'t  her daughter , but you get the idea . )^\n\nThe lady is Helen ,    played by the stunning Jean Tripplehorn , who is n\'t  given a chance to be    stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script .^\n\nThe    child Enola , played by Tina Majorino , is living proof that a child actor    need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ;

   ^\n\nAfter being hired by a Russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes  )  , the Jackal romps all over the Northen Hemisphere  , from Helsinki to Virginia  , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he \'ll   be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion .   ^\n\nAnd like The Saint  , The Jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people .  ^\n\nThe agent working on the case  , Cater Preston ( Sidney Poitier - yes  , that Sidney Poitier  )  , working with a Russian agent  , Valentina Koslova ( Diane Venora - Lady Capulet from  \" Romeo + Juliet  \"  )  , gives up early on and meets with an ex-IRA man  , Declan Mulqueen ( Richard Gere  , putting up some tight competition between himself and Brad Pitt for worst fake Irish accent of \' 97  ) who \'s   in a Massachusetts jail  , but who has apparently seen The Jackal  , who has been eluding the law forever .   ^\n\nSoon  , he \'s   out working with the two untrusting agents  , and trying to help them catch him .  ^\n\nThere are numerous problems with the film  , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on .   ^\n\nThe film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller  , but save a couple moments  , the film never achieves suspense  , or even a sense of intrigue .   ^\n\nSure  , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense  , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register .   ^\n\nThe film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience  , or even an entertaining one .   ^\n\nIt does n\'t   help that the plot is designed to be complex  , but falls into so many problems  , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances .  ^\n\nThe script of  \" The Jackal  \" is a complete mess  , mostly because it ca n\'t   decide what it wants to focus on .   ^\n\nIs this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer  ?

cv134_23300.txt,'\" Reindeer Games  \"  ^\n\nWhat makes Reindeer Games even more disappointing than just a predictable  , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project .  ^\n\nMost of the people involved in Reindeer Games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films .  ^\n\nJohn Frankenheimer  , who made the unforgettable Cold War drama The Manchurian Candidate way back in the early 60 \'s    , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in Ronin .  ^\n\nScreenwriter Ehren Kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated Arlington Rd .   ^\n\nBen Affleck displayed his comedic talents in Dogma and Boiler Room  , and even on Saturday Night Live directly after the horrible Forces of Nature and 200 Cigarettes .  ^\n\nEven Charlize Theron  , who I was convinced could n\'t   act  , did a decent job in Cider House Rules .  ^\n\nWhen all of these bright stars come together  , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining .  ^\n\nAfter coming out of the theater showing Reindeer Games  , disbelief was my first reactionthen frustration .  ^\n\nThe movie could have premiered on Cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining .  ^\n\nThe acting is so pitiful and the script so dull  , I may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are .  ^\n\nIt seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights .  ^\n\nWe have all seen Ben Affleck have some fun on the set  , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in Good Will Hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar .  ^\n\nThe actors in that movie were having fun and  , from that  , the audience had fun .  ^\n\nReindeer Games is the complete opposite  ; the actors do n\'t   seem to want to be their characters ( even Danny Trejo  , who will do practically anything  , does n\'t   look like he is enjoying himself  )  , causing the audience to quickly lose interest .  ^\n\nEvidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled  \" Boy this movie is horrible  !  \" and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments .  ^\n\nThe story follows a man  , Rudy ( Ben Affleck  )  , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate Nick ( James Frain  ) .  ^\n\nNick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman  , Ashley ( Charlize Theron  )  , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person .  ^\n\nWhen Nick is killed in a prison riot  , Rudy decides to pretend to be Nick and take Ashley out on a date for the Christmas holidays .  ^\n\nUnfortunately Ashley \'s   brother  , Gabriel ( Gary Sinise  ) interferes with their relationship .  ^\n\nThinking Rudy is Nick  , he kidnaps Rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino  , which Nick use to work at as a security guard .  ^\n\nNow Rudy must pretend to be Nick so he can protect Ashley from her brother Gabriel .  ^\n\nConfused  ?  ^\n\nThe movie only gets more complex as it goes on  , until it gets way  , way too complex at its climax .   ^\n\nBut Reindeer Games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour .  ^\n\nThe hero commits a greedy  , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date Ashley .  ^\n\nSome hero .  ^\n\nThe point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing  , a person for the audience to relate to or admire .  ^\n\nWhen Rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble  , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys  , I felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times .  ^\n\nThe most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a Christmas movie released in February  ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill Rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason .  ^\n\nThe routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays  , especially when I eagerly want to see the hero dead .   ^\n\nThe only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from Isaac Hayes as a prisoner upset with his food .  ^\n\nWhy he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me .  ^\n\nWhy any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me .

cv137_17020.txt,'Starring: Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Jared Leto, Joshua Jackson, Tara    Reid, John Neville, Robert Englund, Julian Richings, Natasha Wagner     The only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film    had a lot of potential and could\'ve been effective.^\n\nSuch is the case with    _Urban Legend_ , the new horror film from first time director Jamie Blanks .   ^\n\nThe idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people    according to various urban legends .^\n\nExamples include the killer in the    backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house .^\n\nThe    killer wears one of those L.L.

cv138_13903.txt,'My opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors I love .   ^\n\nI love Ralph Fiennes .   ^\n\nI love Uma Thurman .   ^\n\nI love Sean Connery .   ^\n\nHell  , I \'m   even a big fan of Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw .   ^\n\nI saw the fantastic preview for The Avengers nearly eight months ago  , and I \'ve   been eagerly awaiting the film ever since .   ^\n\nA few months into the summer  , however  ,  I noticed that its release date had been changed a few times  , and that it had ended up in the mid-August dumping ground .   ^\n\nThen  , in this final week before its official release  , I learned that it was not to be screened for critics .   ^\n\nAnd that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs .   ^\n\nAnd that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of Diabolique .  ^\n\nMy expectations fell to pieces when I learned all of these things .   ^\n\nThe film I saw today did n\'t   even meet those expectations .   ^\n\nThis is a lousy  , incoherent mess .   ^\n\nI would slam it harder  , if it were n\'t   for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine  , lovable actors .   ^\n\nBut sets are ultimately empty  , and the performances are completely uninspired .   ^\n\nThat \'s   the main problem with The Avengers  :  for all it \'s   hip-hop flash and tidal waves  , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired .   ^\n\nIt \'s   like a chore  , a bland exercise in superhero film making .   ^\n\nIt also feels like its been cut to pieces  , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots .   ^\n\nThis is just plain depressing .  ^\n\nThe Avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show .   ^\n\nFrequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that I \'ve   never watched an episode .   ^\n\nI was n\'t   alive then .   ^\n\nI do n\'t   even watch television now .   ^\n\nI \'m   very sorry that I do n\'t   have this perspective  , but  , judging from the reviews I \'ve   already read  , knowing the TV show just makes matters worse .   ^\n\nI did n\'t   know and love John Steed and Emma Peel  , and therefore I was not as upset to see how these Actors I Love have managed to thrash their roles .    ^\n\nI also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film .   ^\n\nBased on what the film told me  , I gather that Steed ( Fiennes  ) is some kind of British super guy ( somewhat like James Bond  )  , and that Dr. Peel ( Thurman  ) is just a really smart doctor  , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits .   ^\n\nThey are to work together  , under Mother \'s   orders ( Mother is played by jolly Jim Broadbent  , while his co-conspirator  , Father  , is played by the equally-talented Fiona Shaw  ) .    ^\n\nIt seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather .   ^\n\nHis name is De Wynter ( Connery  ) .   ^\n\nHe is a crazy Scottish guy .   ^\n\nOur heroes had better stop him  , or else . . . the weather will keep getting colder until they  \" have to go to hell to warm up  \" ( one of the film \'s   few funny lines  ) .   ^\n\nAlong the way there is subplot after subplot  , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere  , feel perfunctory  , and ultimately make no sense .    ^\n\nFor example  , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos .   ^\n\nNow  , killer bugs do n\'t   really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film .   ^\n\nThe purpose of the bugs  , other than to annihilate our heroes  , is never established .   ^\n\nThey \'re   never even directly connected to De Wynter ( they \'re   controlled by his crazy henchman  , played by Eddie Izzard  ) .   ^\n\nThe special effects are n\'t   bad  , but they \'re   loud  , obnoxious  , and intrusive .   ^\n\nLike so many scenes in the film  , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning .  ^\n\nAnd I guarantee you  , it will wane .   ^\n\nI stopped thinking about the story when I realized it did n\'t   do any good to think .   ^\n\nThe Avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved could n\'t   tell us what happens .   ^\n\nThere are several scenes in the preview that did n\'t   make the final cut .   ^\n\nIn addition  , many of the sequences have irritating  , grainy film quality  , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad  ) .   ^\n\nThe scenes that do n\'t   feature action should be electric  , thanks to our wonderful cast .   ^\n\nThey are n\'t   . ^\n\nThe action scenes should be electric  , because this is an action film .   ^\n\nThey are n\'t    , either .    ^\n\nAnd what about this wasted cast  ?   ^\n\nOh  , it makes me weep with disappointment .   ^\n\nWe \'re   talking Ralph Fiennes here  , one of the best actors working today  , one of the best actors *ever* .   ^\n\nI love the guy .   ^\n\nI \'ve   loved all his films  , until this one .   ^\n\nHe seems like he wants to understand the film  , but he \'s   as lost as we are .   ^\n\nAnd Thurman  , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent  , ca n\'t   manage to look at home here .   ^\n\n( I do n\'t   blame her completely  , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way  , and it ca n\'t   be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting .  )   ^\n\nConnery  , however  , seems the most out of it  , totally lacking any kind of focus  , or interest  , for that matter .    ^\n\nWho is to blame  ?

cv141_17179.txt,'I suppose I \'m   not extremely surprised that  \" Virus  \" comes to us from a  deciple of James Cameron ( John Bruno  )  , and if I strain real hard  , I  could even say that it \'s   an obvious given  , particuarly looking from the  standpoint of Mr. Cameron \'s   early works .  ^\n\nIn fact  ,  \" Virus  \" is yet another  in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the  \" Aliens  \"  vein  : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to  find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them  , a textbook  example hailing all the way back to the early talkies  , and maybe even to  the first pictures  , albeit redeveloped by Cameron in his 1986  blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his  future .  ^\n\nNo such thing will happen to Bruno  , whom I believe worked in  some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature  ; while Bruno may have  studied under Cameron \'s   wing for years and years  , I \'m   beginning to  wonder at what capacity  , and what exactly did he learn from him .  ^\n\nIn  fact  ,  \" Virus  \" should at least be mediocre  ; the fact that Bruno could  have worked under a man like Cameron - a director who  , if anything  , just  knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like  \" Virus  \" is just  another detraction fairly aimed at this Z-grade schlockfest of a film  ,  albeit a Z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget .  ^\n\nThe film seems to not only borrow it \'s   plot from last year \'s    similarly-fated  \" Deep Rising  ,  \" but also from a clunkish B-movie from the  \' 80s called  \" Leviathan  ,  \" an underwater thriller starring Peter Weller  ,  Richard Crenna  , Hector Elizando  , and Daniel Stern about a group of  miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part  \" Alien  ,  \" part  John Carpenter \'s   twisted remake of  \" The Thing .  \"  ^\n\n\" Virus  ,  \" again  , has a  similar  , uh  , selling point  : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a  Russian cruiser that is dead in the water .  ^\n\nThey get on .  ^\n\nThey break up  into pairs and investigate .  ^\n\nAnd they find an alien lifeform on board  that comes in the form of energy  , has taken over all the machines on  board  , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses  , and have deemed  humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha  ) .  ^\n\nNot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving  ;  not only does this film start off with a chintzy Bond-ian opening ( the  destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from Mir  )  ,  destroying any of the suspense in what could happen  , but it also fails  to bring us any interesting chracters .  ^\n\nOf its motley crew  , it only  choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman  skipper  , a masculine potential-romantic-interest  , a drunken captain  , a  black technician  , a tatooed aborigine  , a manic Russian survivor  , and a  couple other candidates for alien food  , none whom are the least bit  interesting or more dimensional than a thin  , plain piece of writing  paper .  ^\n\nAnd it \'s   not the traditional argument for films like these  , where  you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even  \" Aliens  \" played with the  karma of the arrogant soldiers  , but this was more of a plus-side for the  film as a whole than the opposite  )  ; instead  , as another cliche goes  , you  just do n\'t   give a damn .  ^\n\nI almost do n\'t   even have to say that the acting  from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific  , the former being Jamie  Lee Curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and  she is  , just not really here  ) and the latter being - and it pains me to  say this as he \'s   a particular favorite of mine - Donald Sutherland  , who  plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that  this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed .  ^\n\nLike  Anthony Hopkins for  \" Legends of the Fall  \" ( the line  \" Scrooooooo \' em  \" has  been thus embroidered upon my membrance  ) .  ^\n\nOr Peter O\'Toole in   \" Caligula .  \"  ^\n\nGreat actor  , horrific performance .  ^\n\nIt happens every now and  then  , and it only helps Sutherland \'s   career that no one  , except for an  elite few  , even bothered to see this film .  ^\n\nThough it has sat on the shelves of Universal Studios for about two  years  , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it  possibly can ( read  : early January  , when everyone \'s   still trying to catch  up on the potential Oscar-nominees  )  , it does show that Universal shelled  out a pretty penny to make this film  : it \'s   laden with complex machinery  ,  boasts respectable production design  , and it may even feature believable  special effects  ... if  , of course  , I  , or anyone else  , could see them .   ^\n\n\" Virus  \" mostly takes place on a large  , abandoned cruiser  , and mostly at  night until the dawn  , and mostly without the use of lights  , not so much  for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their  human prey  , but more so because  , as the Hollywood cliche seems to go  ,   \" If it \'s   dark enough  , then the special effects will be more believable .  \"   ^\n\nAnd if you do n\'t   believe me  , go back and rent  \" Godzilla  ,  \" and tell me if  there \'s   even one shot where we see Godzilla either a  ) in his entirety in  one wide shot  , or b  ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well  ,  you do n\'t   really have to sit through it again  ; just take my word for  it  ) .  ^\n\nBut all of this does n\'t   matter since  \" Virus  \" is basically just one loud  ,  cluttered mess of a movie .  ^\n\nThe action scenes are muddled and as  difficult to follow as any action movie I \'ve   ever seen ( my  , um  , favorite  part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of  the ship  , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves  , rain  , and  any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up  , then end up back in  the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well  ,  I must say  , thanks for telling me afterwards because I sure could n\'t    figure it out when I saw it  ) .  ^\n\nImagine the first attack of the aliens in   \" Aliens  ,  \" shot from the POV of the soldiers and then the authorities in  the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any  dramatic intensity  , and that \'s   basically the whole of  \" Virus  \"  : one  horribly-directed action scene after the other  , capping it off with a  proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the  original cast members .  ^\n\nAnd my god  , it \'s   a long damn sit .  ^\n\nWith no interesting characters  , no  dramatic urgency  , no tension  , not one good moment of action  , and no  mesmerizing visuals  , it \'s   a wonder that it even got made .  ^\n\nWe already  know that big movie studios  \' mentality is shallow at best  , and movies  like  \" Out of Sight  \" and  \" Saving Private Ryan  \" give you more faith in  them  , but movies like  \" Virus  \" manage to drain a little more out of the  pool .  ^\n\nI almost wish that instead of making this movie  , John Bruno had  gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with Universal heads when  they gave this film a green light .  ^\n\nThey read the script  , they knew they  were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who  might have very well been a Cameron hack ( and he is  )  , and they still  went ahead with the project  , only to have Bruno and company shit back in  their face .  ^\n\nEven though I hold Universal in contempt for making this  horrible movie  , I \'d   say even more contempt should be aimed at Mr. Bruno  for making a movie that could be this bad .  ^\n\nIn fact  , shouts of  \" Egad  ,  man  , what were you doing when you worked for Cameron anyway  ?  \" are not  only justifiable  , but encouraged .

cv145_12239.txt,'It was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or    novels, you must suspend disbelief.^\n\nHowever , there is a distinct separation    between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of    flat lies .^\n\nIt came as no surprise to me to learn that Huntingburg , Indiana    ( where the film is set ) , does not have a McDonald \'s  , a Sears store , a statue    of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by .    ^\n\nEven if you can ignore these somewhat white lies ( even though the dam is    crucial to Hard Rains plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just dont    gel .^\n\nFirstly , Morgan Freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such    films as Driving Miss Daisy , The Shawshank Redemption and Se7en ) , was cast    as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement .   ^\n\nHe  _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat    intriguing policeman .    ^\n\nAs a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms Huntingburg , its    residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases .^\n\nI say    presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems    a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get    introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started .   ^\n\nBut nether the less , armored guard couriers Tom ( Christian Slater ) and his    Uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van .^\n\nWith a    heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesnt    take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of    the road .    ^\n\nJim ( Morgan Freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt    to steal the three million dollars .^\n\nBut of course Tom is more than willing    to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town .    ^\n\nThe local sheriff ( Randy Quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot    in ID4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their    morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates    what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars .    ^\n\nDirector  Mikael  Salomon has made sure that Hard Rain ends up turning    everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a    definite goodies versus baddies , there are numerous twists in its plot that    make  this a slightly more enjoyable experience .^\n\nBut by the time these    interesting changes occur , its far too late in the film for them to have    much affect .^\n\nHard Rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes    out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although its cast is somewhat    appealing most of its stars act well below par .    ^\n\nNot at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle    between Slater and Freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to    do something different and achieved more than what was expected .^\n\nSuch titles    as Broken Arrow ( Slater and John Travolta ) and Face/Off ( Nicholas Cage and    John  Travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen    confrontations .^\n\nStrangely enough , they were both directed by John Woo and    both star John Travolta .    ^\n\nWe  can  forgive  Morgan  Freeman  for giving a slightly disappointing    performance since he is newish to the action genre , but Christian Slater    could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been    reduced and some personality added to his character .^\n\nIf you had asked me    whether Slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie    prior to the release of Broken Arrow , my answer would have been a definite    no. I now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you dont    believe me rent a copy of Broken Arrow from your local video store ) .    ^\n\nAlthough  Hard  Rain never really works from the start , I somehow felt    feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen .^\n\nThe    addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe ,    rather than try to cramminutes of action and disaster into a story that cant    handle anything else .^\n\nDespite the fact that Hard Rain fails on almost every    account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly    enjoyable film .    ^\n\nNo creative flair and no inventive scenes means that Hard Rain does not    stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesnt really matter    since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $ is compare    this to other films.      \n'

cv148_18084.txt,'I have no real tangible proof of this, but I swear that there are a lot of    producers in Hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script,    written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director,    then it is actually possible to make a good movie.^\n\nUsing their logic , all    that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast    a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production    budget .    ^\n\nThis is the only way I can fathom how 20th Century Fox hired Jon Amiel in    order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting    the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) .^\n\nNow , before I continue    to ferociously attack what \'s  wrong with this film , I just want to point out    that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the    potential to be an exciting thriller .^\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones plays Virginia    Baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named    Robert  MacDougal  ( Sean  Connery ) . ^\n\nIf you \'ve  ever seen any Hollywood    blockbuster before , I really do n\'t  have to spend too much time on frivolous    plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for    various purposes .    ^\n\nThe problem we come to is that we \'ve  all seen this a few billion times    before   and   this   film   does n\'t   break  any  new  ground  in  the    big-budget/Hollywood/action genre .^\n\nThe result is that the entire production    feels contrived .^\n\nI \'m  going to be completely honest here : pretty much the    only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at Catherine    Zeta-Jones . ^\n\nNow while this may be a compliment for Ms. Zeta-Jones , it    certainly is n\'t  for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly    as clever as they think they are .^\n\nJust about the most profound thought they    can inject into this film is when they have MacDougal lecture Baker on the    semantic difference between \" entrapment \" and \" blackmail \" .    ^\n\nWith an eighty million dollar budget , you \'d  think that Entrapment would at    least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special F/X .   ^\n\nWell , you \'d  be wrong .^\n\nThe action that is present in this film takes place in    a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular .^\n\nUnfortunately for all    those involved with Entrapment , Die Hard narrowly beat it to the screen    byyears .^\n\nThe reality is that afterminutes of watching this picture , you know    exactly what \'s  going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the    screenplay to throw in plot twists .    ^\n\nMany  scenes  seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit Zeta-Jones in    extremely  tight-fitting clothing .^\n\nOne particular scene features Baker    crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an    ancient Chinese mask .^\n\nNothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from    the  floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why did n\'t  she and    MacDougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the    room ? ^\n\nI \'ll   tell  you  why : because it \'s  a great excuse to photograph    Zeta-Jones \' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also    allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) .    ^\n\nVing Rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great    screen  presence  ( although so do Connery and Zeta-Jones ) and the most    interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the    depths of the Boring Film Abyss ( a concept I invented just to describe this    picture ) .    ^\n\nOne last complaint : Entrapment is littered of instances where MacDougal will    just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a    moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he \'ll  spontaneously disappear in    ninja-like  fashion . ^\n\nI can picture Amiel patting himself on the back ,    thinking to himself \" It \'ll  leave the audience wondering for days : How did he    do that ? \"^\n\nWe know Jon , it \'s  called editing .    ^\n\n'

John Clayton a.k.a. Tarzan  the Ape Man ( Casper Van Dien  ) several days before his marriage to Lady  Jane Porter ( Jane March  ) .   ^\n\nHe is living happily in England  , enjoying the  benefits of being a land-owning noble .   ^\n\nMeanwhile  , in central Africa  ,  the dastardly Nigel Ravens ( Steven Waddington  )  , a self-proclaimed  scholar and explorer  , believes he has found the way to the lost city of  Opar  , which he calls the cradle of civilization .   ^\n\nOn the way there  , he  and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things  , like burning  native villages  , to earn the wrath of the locals .   ^\n\nOne shaman  ,  determined to stop Ravens from unearthing Opal  , sends a mystical message  to Tarzan for help .   ^\n\nWith Lady Jane following close behind  , he returns  to the jungle where he was born .       ^\n\nIts patently obvious that Casper Van Dien ( one of the pretty-boy  heroes of STARSHIP TROOPERS  ) was not hired on the basis of his acting  ability .   ^\n\nWith his plastic facial expressions  , monotone voice  , and  complete inability to make convincing animal noises  , his range rivals  that of Steven Seagal .   ^\n\nHis pecs  , however  , are impressive  , and director  Carl Schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them  off .   ^\n\nJane March  , on the other hand  , has to keep her shirt on  , which may  be a first for her .   ^\n\nSome six years ago  , March give a solid performance  in Jean Jacques Annaud \'s   steamy THE LOVER .   ^\n\nSince then  , she made the  career-killing decision of appearing opposite Bruce Willis in THE COLOR  OF NIGHT  , which exploited her every acting defiency .   ^\n\nTARZAN continues  this trend .   ^\n\nMarch may be attractive  , but  , at least judging by this  performance  , she ca n\'t   act .   ^\n\nMeanwhile  , Steven Waddington has serious  trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad  guy .   ^\n\nInstead  , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance .       ^\n\nThe story line is pure formula  , which has largely been true  throughout the years for almost all of the TARZAN movies .   ^\n\nThe problem  is that this one seems so childish and lifeless .   ^\n\nThe romantic elements  are all contrived  in fact  , Lady Jane \'s   presence is necessary only so  she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance .   ^\n\nThe  special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably  bad men in ape costumes  apparently  , animatronics were too expensive  for this production  ) .   ^\n\nAnd  , of course  , as with all jungle movies  , there  are the obligatory cute animals .       ^\n\nOver the years  , the legend of Tarzan has been one of the most  popular sources for film series material .   ^\n\nThe most famous Ape Man was  Johnny Weismuller  , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed  the part ( including Gordon Scott  , who is widely believed to be the best  actor to tackle the role  ) .   ^\n\nWeismuller made 12 Tarzan features  ; Van Dien  will probably fall 11 short of that number .   ^\n\nAnd  , having seen TARZAN AND  THE LOST CITY  , I would argue that the movie-going public would have been  well served if he had missed by 12 .

cv170_29808.txt,'David Lynch writes and directs a different sort of      movie for him .   ^\n\nThis is a mystery with a very tricky set of      plot twists .   ^\n\nI interpret this film as an attempt to taunt      and play with the genre and its fans .   ^\n\nThis is a film that      has people getting together to discuss what it all means      when it is over .   ^\n\nStill overall I cannot recommend the film .        ^\n\nMULHOLLAND DRIVE did very well at the Cannes Film Festival .   ^\n\nAs  you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the  Toronto International Film Festival .   ^\n\nIt may not be clear to the  viewer why I am so negative on this film for most of the running  time .   ^\n\nIn fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the  backdrop of the Hollywood film industry .   ^\n\nToward the end of the  film I think everything that has been built falls apart .   ^\n\nThe film  was to be a pilot for a TV series but writer and director David  Lynch did not sell his TV pilot and I think he decided that he  wanted to do something else with it .   ^\n\nSomething else is what he  did .   ^\n\nThe film opens with a woman ( played by Laura Harring  ) about to be  killed in a car when a car crash saves her life .   ^\n\nShe crawls away  from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow  with an unlocked door to sleep .   ^\n\nMeanwhile young vivacious Betty  ( Naomi Watts  ) arrives in Hollywood from Canada .   ^\n\nShe wants to  build a career as an actress .   ^\n\nBetty is a little surprised to find  a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow .   ^\n\nShe does not know who  the woman is .   ^\n\nShe is even more surprised when the woman awakes  and does not herself know who she is .   ^\n\nThey fix on a name Rita for  her  , but are not sure if this right or not .   ^\n\nMeanwhile local director Adam Kesher ( Justin Theroux  ) has problems  of his own .   ^\n\nHe is trying to cast one actress for his new film and  is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to  cast someone else  , Cammie Rhodes ( Melissa George  ) .   ^\n\nThese two  threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and  comic murder that goes terribly wrong .   ^\n\nThere is also a strange  character called The Cowboy ( Monty Montgomery  ) adding to the  confusion .   ^\n\nIn what was probably intended for the television pilot the film  opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the  credits .   ^\n\nA lot of MULHOLLAND DRIVE starts out fun .   ^\n\nLynch wants  you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film .   ^\n\nHe just  chooses not to .   ^\n\nAs with any David Lynch film there is strange  material added for little reason .   ^\n\nThere are no earthworms  , but  there are some decidedly strange David Lynch touches .   ^\n\nThe film is  a little long for the subject matter .   ^\n\nToward the end it gets into  some heavier violence and sex scenes  , clearly not intended for the  TV pilot .   ^\n\nUnfortunately some of the most important comments to make about  this film would be spoilers .   ^\n\nI will not mention them in the main  body of the review but I give MULHOLLAND DRIVE a 4 on the 0 to 10  scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .   ^\n\nMULHOLLAND DRIVE Spoiler Warning .   ^\n\nI have rated this film fairly  low .   ^\n\nYou should read this only after seeing the film or deciding  that you will not see the film .   ^\n\nDavid Lynch is in large part a dark satirist .   ^\n\nMost of his work is  done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside .   ^\n\nIn  MULHOLLAND DRIVE I think he is having a laugh at the expense of  the crime film genre .   ^\n\nWhat he does with this film is ( Are you  sure you want to read this  ?  ) playing off the audience expectations  that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .   ^\n\nThe  first 80  \% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story  with clues sprinkled throughout .   ^\n\nThen suddenly at the end he  turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that  appear that they should add up to something .   ^\n\nThe audience  expectation is that they will add up .   ^\n\nBut he has given clues that  are self-contradictory .   ^\n\nLynch wants the audience to argue about  what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .   ^\n\nIn fact  ,  the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until I hear a  better explanation  , I think Lynch is merely playing a joke .   ^\n\nThere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .   ^\n\nMad  Magazine called it a Poiuyt .   ^\n\nOther sources called it a Tri- pronged U-bar .   ^\n\nLook at small portions of it and makes sense .    ^\n\nLook at the whole figure and it does not .   ^\n\nThis film is  , in my  estimation  , the cinematic equivalent of a Tri-pronged U-bar .

cv172_12037.txt,'Watching the movie, I vowed to subtract half a star from the    review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup, cute \'n cuddly,    computer-generated monkey.^\n\nIf the monkey died , the movie got an extra half    star .^\n\nAlas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly    sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs .    ^\n\nWhat that means is that LOST IN SPACE actually deservedstars .^\n\nThat \'s  pretty    generous , considering the movie \'s  camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek .   ^\n\nWhen Will Robinson ( Jack Johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship ,    you are actually supposed to buy it .    ^\n\nSo why such a seemingly high rating ?^\n\nThere are a few reasons that made me    unable to throw away the experience with the garbage .^\n\nFirst , we saw the    movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater .   ^\n\nThe sound and screen kicked ass .^\n\nNobody in the country enjoyed the movie as    much as my audience did ( and I do n\'t  necessarily mean that in a good way ) .   ^\n\nAlso , there were more than zero scenes where I found myself rooting for the    Robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie \'s  tension .^\n\nI even liked the    computer-generated settings .^\n\nI usually prefer to see models or sets , but the    CG  was more detailed than I \'ve  seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like    someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities .    ^\n\nAlso , Gary Oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a    villain .^\n\nWilliam Hurt is n\'t  too bad either .^\n\nNeither actor had a great role ,    but their performances were watchable .    ^\n\nAnd perhaps I should n\'t  admit this , but something about the tone and outlook    of the movie brought me back to my childhood .^\n\nThere is very little swearing    or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is    a bit of romance ( whose culmination afterhours is a \" real \" kiss --  no sex ) .   ^\n\nIt felt like one of those Disney movies that I so looked forward to when I    was six .^\n\nThose movies were probably as bad as LOST IN SPACE , but at the    time , they were manna from Heaven .^\n\nThat type of moviemaking is a lost art .    ^\n\nWorst  and  most  unforgivable  was  the incredibly bad dialogue .^\n\nIt \'s     squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as Pulp Fiction .^\n\n\" You    better hold on to your joystick , \" is one such line .^\n\nAnd when a Robinson is    called  upon  to  deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they    inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest Star Trek    ensign .    ^\n\nSecond worst , and closely related , is the screenplay .^\n\nThe story \'s  exposition    takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain    what \'s  happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest .   ^\n\nOnce the story gets going , I do concede a momentary burst of interest once    in  a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and    contrived .^\n\nWhen Gary Oldman easily reprograms Will \'s  pet robot to kill the    Robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : \" he flipped the switch to    \'evil.\' \"    ^\n\nThen there \'s  the tone of the movie .^\n\nThe Colorado Daily said the film would    have been more interesting if the central character was Will Robinson and    not his father John Robinson .^\n\nThen it could be an adventure movie .^\n\nThey \'re     mostly right , except that Johnson ( Will ) was n\'t  a good enough actor to carry    it off .^\n\nStill , that the film has the Robinson patriarch as our hero shows a    lack of imagination .^\n\nJust because a movie is tame enough for kids does n\'t     mean that we have to bow to a \" promise keepers \" notion of who \'s  the center    of a family .^\n\nMany quality family films have been made with a non-traditional    family structure ( FLY AWAY HOME comes to mind ) to much better effect .    ^\n\nAnd the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a    futuristic movie .^\n\nIn STAR WARS , the rebels were the good guys .^\n\nWe were    rooting for those who were fighting against the system .^\n\nIn LOST IN SPACE ,    the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed    and silenced so that our children may live free .^\n\nThat ominous excuse for    violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists .    ^\n\nFinally , a few specific details deserve criticism .^\n\nThe movie tells us that    the setting is the year 2056 .^\n\nWhy ?^\n\nWhy bother saying what year this is .^\n\nJust    tell us it \'s  the future .^\n\nI bring it up because the TV series was supposed to    take  place  in 1997 .^\n\nSetting a specific date only dates the movie and    guarantees that it wo n\'t  be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the    running anyway. ) .^\n\nThen there is a scene that shows John Robinson checking    one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole .^\n\nThis    silly waste of money reminded me of Bugs Bunny \'s  barber chair , and only    shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers have n\'t  learned a    thing about ergonomics .    ^\n\nOne vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest    of the film failed : it made LOST IN SPACE look cool .^\n\nThe strong techno beat    sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip .^\n\nThis    is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips    from the movie .    ^\n\nBut  if  that \'s  the best part of the movie , I ca n\'t  in good conscience    recommend it .^\n\nStill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be    able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies    as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards .    ^\n\n'

California ? )^\n\nI    learned very little about the entertainment business from PERMANENT MIDNIGHT    and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead .^\n\nOf course you know that Stahl    triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems .^\n\nSo , basically , his    drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he \'s     apparently collaborating with Stiller on future projects .^\n\nSo much for the    moral of that story .^\n\nTEMPORARY MIDNIGHT is more like it. -Bill Chambers ;    September , 1998 '

cv181_16083.txt,'There\'s something to be said for reality, and MTV Productions\' latest movie,    VARSITY BLUES, proves it beyond a doubt.^\n\nEven the most flawed movies --     those  filled  with  bad acting , poor direction , horrible writing , and    misguided photography --  can salvage some dignity by clinging to reality .   ^\n\nBut when any real-world sense is thrown out the window , as in VARSITY BLUES ,    the product becomes a 100-minute travel along a downward spiral .^\n\nDirected by    GOOD   BURGER   helmer   Brian   Robbins ,   VARSITY  BLUES  is  easily    bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment .    ^\n\nAs with any Gen-X MTV movie ( like last year \'s  DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS ) , the movie    is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling    points : sex and football .^\n\nThose two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure    package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales    will decline for two reasons .^\n\nFirst , the football sequences are nothing new ,    nor can they be ; the sports genre is n\'t  mainstream and it \'s  been retread to    death .^\n\nSecond , the sex is just bad .^\n\nDespite the appearance of a whipped    cream  bikini  or the all-night strip-club party , there \'s  nothing even    remotely tantalizing .    ^\n\nThe acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic Jon Voight .   ^\n\nCultivating his usual sliminess , Voight gives an unexpectedly standout    performance as West Canaan Coyotes head coach Bud Kilmer .^\n\nKilmer is the    driving force behind the Coyotes \' twenty-two conference championships and    two  state  titles  in  thirty  years ;  this  year he plans to make it    twenty-three .^\n\nUnfortunately , when his star quarterback , Lance Harbor ( Paul    Walker ) ,  goes  down for the count , he \'s  got to rely on the unreliable    abilities of backup John Moxon ( James Van Der Beek ) .^\n\nMoxon leads the team    through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom ,    the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend Julie ( Amy Smart ) , and    other temptations that abound in football-crazy West Canaan .    ^\n\nMost regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as Texas , and    so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most .^\n\nSimilarly , the set design is    wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling    uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead    require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of    Coach Kilmer .^\n\nThese elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing )    might be more appropriate on a college campus --  but MTV \'s  core audience is    the  high  school demographic .^\n\nThis focus is further emphasized by the    casting : James Van Der Beek , of TV \'s  \" Dawson \'s  Creek , \" is an understandable    choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with    the role .^\n\nOther stars are similarly young and unmemorable .    ^\n\nThere \'s  not much that goes right about VARSITY BLUES , and there \'s  not much    to like about it , either .^\n\nEverything herein has already been done , and if it    has n\'t  , the movie manages to botch it one way or another .^\n\nThis is certainly    missable . \n'
cv182_7791.txt,'Nicolas Cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in    the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama CON AIR.^\n\nThe opening credits    sequence introduces us to Cage as Cameron Poe , a Gulf War veteran convicted    of  manslaughter  and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated    bar-room brawl .^\n\nThe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which    Poe , in a languid Southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back    home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met .^\n\nIf the    scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should .^\n\nCage appears to    realize that CON AIR is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and    that he \'s  going to have to do something to keep himself entertained .^\n\nAnd    thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the    proceedings --  Cage plays Cameron Poe as a buffed-up version of RAISING    ARIZONA \'s  H. I. McDonnough .    ^\n\nCage should have known what he was getting himself into .^\n\nHe got a paycheck    from Jerry Bruckheimer last year for THE ROCK , and if there \'s  one thing you    can count on from a Bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner    Don Simpson ) , it \'s  that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the    _last_ Bruckheimer production .^\n\nThe critical difference between THE ROCK and    CON AIR is Cage \'s  performance .^\n\nIn THE ROCK , Cage appeared to be having the    time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time .^\n\nThat sense    of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness .^\n\nWhile the plot of    CON AIR finds Poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose    goal is just to get home , Cage \'s  goal is different but just as simple : to    get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact .    ^\n\nAudiences , too , should know what they \'re  getting themselves into with a    Bruckheimer production .^\n\nIn fact , the marketing people are counting on it .^\n\nNo    one who loathed THE ROCK for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be    converted by CON AIR ; no one who loved THE ROCK for exactly the same reasons    will be dissuaded .^\n\nDirector Simon West ( yet another TV commercial auteur    plucked by Bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the Schwab \'s  soda    fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail    which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it \'s  perversely appropriate    that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ;    like insulin , CON AIR does the work of a gland ) .^\n\nWhat he does n\'t  deliver is    a moment of suspense .^\n\nA Bruckheimer film has no use for Hitchcock \'s  notion    that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene    than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really ,    _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely .    ^\n\nIf either West or Bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might    have done something with CON AIR \'s  creepiest set-up .^\n\nAt a desert stop for    the plane-load of convicts , serial killer Garland Greene ( Steve Buscemi )    wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea    party in a drained swimming pool .^\n\nTheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing ,    providing a welcome shift in tone and giving Buscemi a chance to stand out    in  a  cast  with  too  many  villains ( Danny Trejo , Ving Rhames and a    characteristically reptilian John Malkovich among them ) .^\n\nIn fact , CON AIR    usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint    would have been an improvement --  too many characters , too much editing , too    many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo    which characterize too many Bruckheimer efforts .    ^\n\nIt is that kind of exhausting excess to which Cage is responding with his    detached performance .^\n\nWhile Malkovich goes for the outrageous and John    Cusack ( as a U. S. Marshal ) goes for earnest , Cage looks like he just wants    to go to sleep .^\n\nHis recycled RAISING ARIZONA performance is a means of    escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of    that big box of Huggies .^\n\nIt does n\'t  bode well for Cage \'s  appearance in    FACE/OFF later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in    action films is more of the same over and over .^\n\nThere \'s  a word for people    like you , Nicolas .^\n\nThat word is called recidivist ... repeat offender .

cv187_14112.txt,'54 is dull  , perfunctory  , uninspired  , and boring .   ^\n\nA greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives  , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors .   ^\n\nI  , however  , would rather cut to the chase .   ^\n\n54 is dull  , perfunctory  , uninspired  , and boring .   ^\n\nThere is nothing in it --   not a glimpse of depth  , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight .   ^\n\nThere is no electricity in any of the scenes  , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots .   ^\n\nAnd it \'s   underdeveloped  , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they \'re   in this year \'s   Boogie Nights .   ^\n\nThey are so wrong .   ^\n\nThe picture has been assembled by Mark Christopher .   ^\n\nBased on this film  , I do n\'t   know how he got a job in the business .    ^\n\n54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name  , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s .   ^\n\nI do n\'t   know if this film went into production after Boogie Nights was released  , but Christopher has managed to plagiarize Paul Thomas Anderson \'s   brilliant work in every possible way  , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography .   ^\n\nWhat it lacks is everything that made Boogie Nights great  :  depth  , intelligence  , energy  , fascinating characters  , and challenging themes .   ^\n\n54 ca n\'t   even measure up to The Last Days of Disco  , which is flawed  , but still smart and entertaining .   ^\n\nIt \'s   remarkably bad timing  , I \'d   say  , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind .  ^\n\nI have exaggerated  , though  :  there is one interesting character  , and one terrific performance .   ^\n\nThat character is Steve Rubell  , played with more perceptiveness by Mike Myers than this limp production deserves .   ^\n\nSteve Rubell is the owner of Studio 54  , and if Christopher had focused on him  , then Myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself .   ^\n\nAlas  , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named Shane ( Ryan Phillippe  )  , a going-nowhere New Jersey teen who gets a job in the club  , thanks to Rubell \'s   homosexual impulses .   ^\n\nIt \'s   here that he meets his friends  , the array of uninteresting characters  :  his co-worker  , Greg ( Brecklin Meyer  )  , his wife  , Anita ( Salma Hayek  )  , and  , of course  , the love interest  , Julie Black ( Neve Campbell  ) .  ^\n\nShane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning  , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life .   ^\n\n( Some of the scenes with his father border on interesting  , while Heather Matarazzo  , who plays his sister  , pushes Phillippe off the screen .  )   ^\n\nBut he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene  , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs .   ^\n\nWhy his  \" friends  \" push him into drugs is never really explained  , but the fact that they are  \" friends  \" is questioned only is superficial ways ( Greg gets really mad at Shane because he \'s   been elevated to bartender status  ) .   ^\n\nThere is n\'t   a single conflict that takes center stage  , except that Shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works .    ^\n\nMost of the film is dumb  , and most of the dialogue is inane .   ^\n\nThere \'s   a scene late in the film in which Shane confronts Julie Black  , and  , in the next scene  , they \'re   arm-in-arm without a bit of development .   ^\n\nThen  , they \'re   kissing in a bowling alley  !   ^\n\nThis is five minutes of material  , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark  , and this is n\'t   a long film to begin with  ) .   ^\n\nCampbell is a talented actress  , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth .   ^\n\nThis one does n\'t   . ^\n\nAnd Phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever  ; this performance pales in comparison to Mark Whalberg \'s   star-making role in Boogie Nights .   ^\n\nHe seems dumb and misguided  , and his voice never changes tone .   ^\n\nI guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body  , but he seems pretty lanky to me .   ^\n\nHe \'s   all wrong for a lead role  , but it does n\'t   help that Christopher has forgotten to develop his characters .   ^\n\nBy the end of 54  , Shane \'s   most notable trait is his stupid  , fake accent .    ^\n\nThe rest of the performances are wasted .   ^\n\nHayek is an energetic  , talented young actress  , and does almost nothing here .   ^\n\nMeyer is endearing  , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard .   ^\n\nOnly Myers  , by sheer force of talent  , manages to rise above Christopher \'s   wading-pool of a script .   ^\n\nRubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters  , but Myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance .   ^\n\nIn fact  , Myers is the sole reason to see 54  , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him .  ^\n\nI \'ve   read that Studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail .   ^\n\nFrankly  , I do n\'t   care .   ^\n\nIt \'s   easy to recreate something technical like this .   ^\n\nA fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task .   ^\n\nBesides  , Christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible  , anyway .   ^\n\nAside from Myers  \' performance  , 54 is a complete failure .   ^\n\nIt \'s   dull  , perfunctory  , uninspired  , and boring .   ^\n\nSome may find my comparisons to Boogie Nights unfair  , but they \'re   so obvious to me .   ^\n\nIn any event  , 54 is pallid without the contrast .   ^\n\nIt does n\'t   even work as mindless entertainment  :  it \'s   so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it .   ^\n\nSo  , do n\'t   forget those key words  :  dull  , perfunctory  , uninspired  , and boring .   ^\n\nEverything else I said was just padding  .'

cv191_29539.txt,'After enduring Mariah Carey \'s   film debut  , Glitter  , I \'m   reminded of a bit from Chris Rock \'s   Bigger and Blacker .   ^\n\nIn response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man  , Rock says  ,  \" You can drive a car with your feet  , but that do n\'t   mean it should be done .  \"   ^\n\nTo that I say  , you can give Mariah Carey a movie  , but that certainly do n\'t   mean it should be done .  ^\n\nSure  , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there --   from The Beatles  \' A Hard Day \'s   Night to the Spice Girls  \' Spice World --   but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as Glitter .   ^\n\nEverything about this complete tripe is ludicrous .  ^\n\nStart off with the story  , which --   as gruesomely predictable as it is --   is the least offensive part of the movie .  ^\n\nThe film is inexplicably set in the 80s  , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers .   ^\n\nWorse yet  , everyone \'s   speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 .   ^\n\nMeant to be partially autobiographical  , Carey plays Billie Frank  , a young singer in New York who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother .   ^\n\nInfluential club DJ Julian Dice  , a.k.a.  \" Lucky 7  \" ( Max Beesley playing a bad mix of Puff Daddy and Robert De Niro  )  , hears her sing on a track  , and decides to make her a star .   ^\n\nIn predictably rapid succession  , Billie and Dice fall for each other  , she starts hitting it big  , Dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass  , and suddenly Billie \'s   on  \" the roller coaster of superstardom .  \"   ^\n\nIn the meantime  , Billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom .   ^\n\nI wo n\'t   give away the ending  , but --   honestly --   just think of unicorns and rainbows   ... you \'ll   figure it out .  ^\n\nThe movie screams to be made with camp  , and that could \'ve   been fun .   ^\n\nBut the filmmakers thought making the bulk of Glitter weepy and dramatic would be better .   ^\n\nWhat a mistake .   ^\n\nThe brief attempts at comic relief --   as in a scene where an effeminate Russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming Billie \'s   first music video --   go over like lead balloons .   ^\n\nInstead  , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during Mariah \'s   most dramatic scenes .  ^\n\nWhich brings us to the performances  , of which there \'s   nothing good that can be said .   ^\n\nMariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face .   ^\n\nShe actually looks scared during her one love scene .  ^\n\nBut you have to wonder if the writing is n\'t   even worse .   ^\n\nSo much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for Carey \'s   virginal target audience that it \'s   probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb .   ^\n\nEven the characters could n\'t   have been written more absurdly .   ^\n\nThey \'re   all members of a Barbie playset  : the important film director who swoons  ,  \" Billie  , I \'d   love to put you in a movie I \'m   making  ,  \" and the big-time record executive who takes Billie \'s   demo tape and says  ,  \" Oh  , I \'ll   make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning .  \"   ^\n\nEveryone in the film is a device  , and it \'s   painful to keep watching just to see another one appear .  ^\n\nTo say more would be a waste .   ^\n\nThere \'s   so much wrong with this film .   ^\n\nAnd  , it pains me that Mariah Carey --   with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days  , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays --   will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she \'s   likely to get .  ^\n\nBut  , then again  , I had to suffer through her movie .

Moriarty (Donny), Frank Vincent (Ray Sr.), 1997)     This independent film written and directed by Eric Bross has the look and    feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated    the market in recent times.^\n\nIt is hard to tell what is independent about    this  film ;  it might as well have been made in Hollywood or on a home    videocam .^\n\nIt is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal    story about Italians growing up with heavy New Jersey accents and remaining    tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could    have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the    characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different    story : it is old news .^\n\nThe love story between the simple girl waiting to get    married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her does n\'t  mean much ,    since their relationship remained undeveloped .^\n\nThe introduction of the    wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough    emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film    above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the    star of the film , Adrien Brody as Ray .    ^\n\nRay is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an    illegal  casino  operation out of his Bloomfield , New Jersey , suburban    basement .^\n\nRay Sr. ( Vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a    small scale home-repair business .^\n\nHis son lives with him and works unhappily    as  a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a    business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend Joanne ( Sybil ) .    ^\n\nThe title of this film refers to the shoe size of Paul Newman-10B , which    really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film.You should    be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that do n\'t  make    sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful    growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to    feel any empathy for them .    ^\n\nDesperate  to  make  his  dream come through , Ray goes to a loanshark ,    humorously and menacingly played by James E. Moriarty , and borrows 10 grand    to bet on a \" sure thing \" at Freehold Raceway .^\n\nThe horse loses and now Ray    has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get    his dough .    ^\n\nThere is nothing I have seen so far to like about Ray .^\n\nHe is undependable ,    mean-spirited , and stupid .^\n\nSo when his best friend Mike ( Gallagher ) , the    narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend -- who cares ?   ^\n\nThe director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do .    ^\n\nAs for Ray \'s  gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story    is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen .   ^\n\nHis buddies , the college student Mike and the dependable Butchie ( Gillan ) ,    and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his    aid .^\n\nAnd the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that    seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as Ray is    off to Florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together .    ^\n\nThere was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial    film to keep it interesting , though Adrien Brody showed signs that he could    be a future star .^\n\nBecause of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of Sean    Penn .    ^\n\nDennis Schwartz : \" Ozus \' World Movie Reviews \"     ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ '

cv200_29006.txt,'The much anticipated re-adaptation of the Pierre     Boulle novel comes to the screen as  a dark and a little     dreary film with lots of chases and fighting  , but very little     intelligence .   ^\n\nVisually  there is much to like about this     version  , but the approach is to take an adventure after the     style of  GULLIVER \'S   TRAVELS and treat it as an action film .      ^\n\nThat makes it a film without much center .    ^\n\nPierre Boulle  , author of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI  , wrote PLANET OF THE APES  ( a.k.a. MONKEY PLANET  )  , the novel  , as a social satire .   ^\n\nIt reads a lot like a fifth book of  GULLIVER \'S   TRAVELS .   ^\n\nHumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have  been reversed  , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on Jonathan Swift \'s   island of the  Houyhnhnms .   ^\n\nThe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the  things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet .   ^\n\nIt seems to me there is also a  statement about human cruelty to animals  , but perhaps I was just looking for that .  ^\n\nWhen Rod Serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968  , he added a number of Serling  touches  , familiar from episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE and changed the ending to make it  more Serling-ish .   ^\n\nThe final irony of the original version has become film history .   ^\n\nWithout it there  could never have been a  \" Planet of the Apes  \" film series .   ^\n\nI can surmise only that Serling ran into  serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language .   ^\n\nIn the book the apes had  their own language and the human eventually learned that language .   ^\n\nThat could have been done in  the film  , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking .  ^\n\nSerling avoided this by having the apes speak English and  , of course  , there is some justification  for that by the end of the film .   ^\n\nJustifying why the apes spoke English may have even been the  inspiration for his surprise ending .   ^\n\nBut Serling never tackles the all-important question of why a  supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his  own language  , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear .   ^\n\nFew viewers questioned this  serious plot hole  , however  , and the film has become well respected in cinema history .   ^\n\nPartial  credit at least should go to Jerry Goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of Goldsmith \'s   best if not his best .  ^\n\nWhen the film \'s   success called for sequels  , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added  well-intentioned  , though not very subtle  , political messages about what was happening in the United States of the 1960s and 1970s .   ^\n\nWhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what  was there seemed a little half- hearted  , by the second film  , BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE  APES  , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence  and chases .   ^\n\nThe series concluded with BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES in 1973 .    ^\n\nNow director Tim Burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .  ^\n\nFor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book  , Burton \'s   new  version is even less faithful .   ^\n\nFirst  , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes .  ^\n\nHe has them both be intelligent  , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in  the hands  , uh  , make that paws  , of the apes .   ^\n\nThat could be a good story too  , but it is not PLANET  OF THE APES .   ^\n\nAs with the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE films and so many other cinematic  homages to the third quarter of the last century  , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have  no intention of honoring .  ^\n\nIn 2029 Leo Davidson ( Mark Wahlberg  , not this world \'s   most expressive actor  ) works on a space  station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes .   ^\n\nThen a convenient time storm sweeps  him up WIZARD-OF-OZ-fashion and drops him on an alien planet .   ^\n\n( Yes  , he survives this storm  ,  but then no storm is perfect .  )   ^\n\nHe quickly finds  , not greatly to any surprise he shows  , that on this  planet apes rule and humans drool  , but everybody talks .   ^\n\nAnd the language they talk is Earth- English .  ^\n\nApparently it does not even occur to Leo that there is a mystery that needs to be  explained about that .   ^\n\nThe fact it does not occur to Leo and apparently did n\'t   occur to Tim Burton  either is the heart of the real horror of this film .   ^\n\nBoth just assumed that if apes were going to talk  the language they would speak would be English .   ^\n\nIn any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave  relationships .   ^\n\nOutside of Sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .  ^\n\nLeo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by Ari  , played by Helena Bonham  Carter .   ^\n\nAri is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .   ^\n\nShe is bent on making the  world a better place .   ^\n\nPerhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called Hil-Ari .   ^\n\nIn any case  with makeup that stifles her usual pout  , Carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a  film .   ^\n\nShe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .  ^\n\nIt is not long before Leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .   ^\n\nThis is  a further abandonment of the source material .   ^\n\nThe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and  human and the examination of each \'s   place in this reversed society  , each important in the book .    ^\n\nWe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .    ^\n\nWe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .   ^\n\nBurton chooses visceral  thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .   ^\n\nThis is a miscalculation  , as characters so lacking in  empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in .   ^\n\nThey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .  ^\n\nThe 1968 script had little subtlety  ,  with lines like  \" I never met an ape I did n\'t   like  ,  \" but at least we cared for what happened to Taylor  ,  the main character .   ^\n\nMost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .  ^\n\nThe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in  the night or in fog .   ^\n\nThis tends to limit close looks at the makeup .   ^\n\nIn general it seems much  improved from 1968 .   ^\n\nThe makeup team is led by Rick Baker instead of John Chambers  , who did  it for the 1968 version .  ^\n\nIn 1968 Chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper .  ^\n\nIt was realistic enough to  almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .  ^\n\nChambers is good  , but if anyone had a  chance to best him it would have to be Baker .   ^\n\nToday audiences have higher expectations  ; Baker \'s    visualization is really an improvement .  ^\n\nThese visuals work nicely .   ^\n\nWhat does not work is the  wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .   ^\n\nThey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of CROUCHING TIGER  , HIDDEN DRAGON .   ^\n\nApes spring incredible distances .    ^\n\nSome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture  , but when  they start flying through the air the effect is lost .   ^\n\nOne final visual problem is that the film  frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only  a small group of people close-up .  ^\n\nSince the days of Lon Chaney and Boris Karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role  that required heavy make-up .  ^\n\nThe one actor who has a shot is Paul Giamatti .   ^\n\nIt is not that his  lines are so good  , most are silly jokes .   ^\n\nBut he delivers them very well .   ^\n\nHe was always a  watchable actor  , but has not yet made stardom .   ^\n\nAs the ape-trader Limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up  , but does it very well .   ^\n\nIn doing so he makes himself the most  interesting thing on the screen .   ^\n\nHe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories  of Peter Ustinov \'s   performance in SPARTACUS .  ^\n\nAs an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape  played by Charleton Heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .   ^\n\nDanny Elfman \'s   score has a nice primitive feel  , but Jerry Goldsmith \'s   1968 tour de force score is a real classic .  ^\n\nThat  score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten .

cv206_15893.txt,'This is my first review that I post to this newsgroup, and I kind of feel    like I have to say something negative about this film.^\n\nNo one else seems to    care  that  it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a    historical story .^\n\nHowever , even if one thinks of it as fiction , \" The Prince    of Egypt \" remains shallow .^\n\nBut I \'ll  begin from the beginning .^\n\nThe biggest    difference between the original , Biblical story and this version is that    Moses has some semblance of divinity in the Bible , whereas the animated    version gives the impression of a reluctant hero .^\n\nMaybe it \'s  just me , but if    I knew I had God on my side , I \'d  have a little bit more confidence .^\n\nThere    are other differences as well , such as a lack of important female characters    and the passing over of the original Pharoah \'s  death like it \'s  nothing but a    thing .^\n\nMost of all , though , the story \'s  focus has shifted .^\n\nRather than being    a story about father-son , man-ethnicity , man-God , \" The Prince of Egypt \" is    almost solely about the brother-brother relationship between Rameses and    Moses .^\n\nI was originally excited about this story element until I saw the    movie ,  where  it came off as maudlin .^\n\nRameses and Moses squabble like    children and then , in the interests of peace , Moses saves Rameses \' butt ,    even though Moses was the one who started it  ... yawn I did n\'t  care anymore    by the time Moses ran off for murdering an overseer ( which , of course , never    happened in the original story - Moses was exiled ) .^\n\nBut enough about the    differences .^\n\nLet \'s  talk about the movie itself .^\n\nIt features a Moses who , in    the  interests  of making the character more human , lacks any divinity    whatsoever , which is n\'t  convincing at all to anyone who knows who God is .^\n\nIt    features a cookie-cutter \" I-wanna-please-dada \" Rameses , who at least is    given dignity by the voicework of Ralph Fiennes ( from Schindler \'s  List ,    among other things ) .^\n\nThe film also features an extremely annoying character    by  way  of the \" new-improved \" Miriam , voiced by the ever-antsy Sandra    Bullock , even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to    burst  into song for no apparent reason ( here Bullock is replaced by a    singing voice ) .^\n\nSpeaking of which , it contains very annoying music .^\n\nIt    contains shallow writing .^\n\nIt features extraordinary animation , which is one    good thing I can say about this film .^\n\nMost of all , it contains an attempt to    commercialize , homogenize , and mass-market a story about a Manifestation of    God .^\n\nI am not Christian , but I got the impression of blasphemy .^\n\nThe writers    and producers took a butcher knife and chop-chopped into the story .

cv207_29141.txt,'Original Sin ( 2001  )   ^\n\nFor  \" Original Sin  ,  \" the road to the screen has been rocky .  ^\n\nInitially slated for release last November  , the film was bumped twice  , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 .  ^\n\nAdvance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics  , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands .  ^\n\nSo is  \" Original Sin  \" really all that bad  ?  ^\n\nYes it is  , but the melodrama does offer some rewards .  ^\n\nThe location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of T&A ( with Angelina Jolie providing the  \" T  \" and Antonio Banderas the  \" A  \"  ) .  ^\n\nMore importantly  , the movie is entertainingly bad .  ^\n\nVeteran readers know that  , as a rule  , I do n\'t   encourage people to patronize lousy films .  ^\n\nMost of the time  , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides  , the  \" let \'s   go laugh at the failings of others  \" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable .  ^\n\nBut things are different this summer .  ^\n\nQuality films  , to put it mildly  , have been few and far between  , so as far as I \'m   concerned  , it \'s   fair to find our kicks where we may .  ^\n\n\" Original Sin  \" will never join such treasures as  \" Valley of the Dolls  ,  \"  \" Road House  \" and  \" Showgirls  \" in the Bad Movie Hall of Fame  , but it \'ll   do until something worse comes along .  ^\n\nThe film  , adapted by director Michael Cristofer from the Cornell Woolrich novel  ,  \" Waltz into Darkness  \" ( which was also the source for the 1969 Francois Truffaut film  ,  \" Mississippi Mermaid  \"  )  , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison  , as Jolie \'s   character  , slated for a dawn execution  , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny .  ^\n\nThe freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like  ,  \" This is not a love story  , it is a story about love .  \"  ^\n\nWary of local gold-diggers  , Cuban coffee dealer Luis Antonio Vargas ( Banderas  ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from America  , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers .  ^\n\nA practical man  , Luis chooses a frumpy looking lady  , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children .  ^\n\nImagine his surprise when his fiance  , Julia Russell ( Jolie  )  , turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo .  ^\n\nJulia explains that she sent a different woman \'s   image because she did n\'t   want to be selected solely for her pretty face .  ^\n\nLuis then confesses his deception  , leading Julie to state  , with great significance  ,  \" We have something in common  , We are both not to trusted .  \"  ^\n\nAfter their wedding  , Luis and Julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking  , with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible .  ^\n\nJolie and Banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun  , although the filmmakers  \' insistence on using one of Banderas  \' legs to cover Jolie \'s   crotch makes it look like he \'s   trying to climb her .  ^\n\nLuis  , the stupidest man who ever lived  , immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to Julia  , despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded .  ^\n\nHis blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up .  ^\n\nLuis must force Julia to write to her sister Emily  , who is frantic over her lack of communication .  ^\n\nShortly after Julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird  , it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck .  ^\n\nFinally  , when she cleans out his accounts and disappears  , Luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong .  ^\n\nIncidentally  , if you \'re   afraid I \'m   giving too much away  , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie  , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists  , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass .  ^\n\nAlong the way  , private detective Walter Downs ( played by Thomas Jane  , who was terrific as Mickey Mantle in the HBO movie  \" 61*  \"  ) turns up  , hired by the frumpy woman \'s   sister to find out what happened to the real Julia .  ^\n\nLuis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist  , having decided that if he ca n\'t   have her  , he will kill her .  ^\n\nOh  , the pathos of it all .  ^\n\nThe cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story  , adjusting their performances accordingly .  ^\n\nBanderas is suitably impassioned  , while Jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips  , she can really pout  ) .  ^\n\nAs for Thomas Jane  , he starts off acting suspicious and cagey  , then accelerates to a Snidely Whiplash level of nastiness .  ^\n\nHis most startling moment comes when  , to prove his power to humiliate  , he forces Luis against a wall  , verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of Luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full-on kiss .  ^\n\nIf anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape  , show them this chilling scene .  ^\n\nAnd if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler  , show them  \" Original Sin .  \"    '

\"^\n\nAnd then , of course , there \'s  Doogie \'s  mind meld with a bug .    ^\n\nIt \'s  possible that Verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era    of the original novel .^\n\nHeinlein \'s  pre-\"Stranger In A Strange Land \" books    were aimed at adolescent males , and \" Starship Troopers \" has the antiseptic    retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi .^\n\nThe one cityscape shown is a    Jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious    matte painting .^\n\nThe hairstyles are retro too , straight from the Frankie    Avalon , Annette Funicello school of fashion .    ^\n\nUltimately , Verhoeven \'s  motives are irrelevant .^\n\nHe has produce a gargantuan    film that fails as an action film or as a social satire .^\n\nIt even fails to be    an entertaining bad movie .^\n\nAvoid \" Starship Troopers \" at all costs .

cv219_19874.txt,'Last summer  , a feature-length version of The Avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning .  ^\n\nBased on the famous 60 \'s   television show  , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for Warner Bros .  ^\n\nA year later  , the studio is up to their old tricks again  , with the unnecessary revival of the Robert Conrad program The Wild  , Wild West .  ^\n\nBut it sounded promising  : the same tag-team of star Will Smith and director Barry Sonnenfeld  , who both contributed to make Men in Black such a financial success  , is at the reins again .  ^\n\nAnd co-star Kevin Kline is attached to the project  , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects .  ^\n\nI mean  , what could possibly go wrong  ?  ^\n\nThe answer is just about everything .  ^\n\nWild Wild West is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate .  ^\n\nThere are a lot of fancy special effects  , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression .  ^\n\nBut the script is so deliriously uneven  , the entire movie so off course  , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it .  ^\n\nAt square one  , we have a bizarre case of casting .  ^\n\nWill Smith plays James West  , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor Robert Conrad in the TV series .  ^\n\nMy guess regarding the casting of African-American Smith is a simple one  : the actor + a cozy summertime release  big bucks for all those involved .  ^\n\nSmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material  , but this is not an ideal role for him .  ^\n\nHe \'s   too much of a joker .  ^\n\nI heard that initial casting included George Clooney in the lead role  , and frankly  , that sounds a lot more plausible .  ^\n\nWhat makes matters worse is that Smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes  ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows Wild Wild West will be a huge hit at the summer box office .  ^\n\nThe plot involves West and cross-dressing government agent Artemus Gordon ( Kevin Kline  )  , who are assigned by the President to recover a group of kidnapped scientists .  ^\n\nThe trail leads to the diabolical Dr. Arliss Loveless ( Kenneth Branagh  )  , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry  , witty southern accent .  ^\n\nLoveless has taken the country \'s   top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control  , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns .  ^\n\nOne such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula  , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right .  ^\n\nThe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular  , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , all of these effects seem so detached from the story  , and can do little to support the film \'s   plot deficiencies  , which are undoubtedly the main problem .  ^\n\nWild Wild West is a running gag that never truly works .  ^\n\nMost of the jokes  , usually care of Smith  , die on arrival .  ^\n\nIf it \'s   one thing that could possibly be the saving grace  , it \'s   the performances  , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered .  ^\n\nKline is admirable  , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot .  ^\n\nSalma Hayek is wasted as the romantic interest  , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between West and Gordon .  ^\n\nBranagh  , an esteemed Shakespearean actor and director  , adds marginal enjoyment to the film .  ^\n\nBut even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top .  ^\n\nRarely is a film so lost in itself as Wild Wild West is .  ^\n\nI suppose there \'s   always one turkey of the summer season  ; a highly anticipated  , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint .  ^\n\nWild Wild West is such a movie  , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 .  ^\n\nBut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office .  ^\n\nPerhaps after this  , audiences will be less assured when they see Will Smith \'s   name stamped on a summer movie .  ^\n\nAfter such hits as Independence Day and MiB  , Wild Wild West is not an impressive addition to the resume .

cv220_28906.txt,'Swordfish ( 2001  )   ^\n\nAt the outset of Swordfish  , John Travolta \'s   Gabriel Shear is pontificating about the status of American cinema today .   ^\n\nBasically  , he says  , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers .   ^\n\nHow ironic  , as Travolta seems to be describing his latest venture .   ^\n\nSwordfish is loud  , violent and amoral .  ^\n\nIt has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life .   ^\n\nAnd how does Travolta \'s   Gabriel plan to do this  ?  ^\n\nBy robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists .   ^\n\nSwordfish is a very cynical movie .  ^\n\nIt relies on an audience \'s   perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human  , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration .   ^\n\nThe movie \'s   plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down  , you \'d   actually see how ridiculous it all is .  ^\n\nThis is a live-action Road Runner cartoon  , moving so quickly that it \'s   over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions .   ^\n\nThe storyline revolves around super hacker Stanley Jobson ( Hugh Jackman  )  , recruited by Gabriel to crack the government \'s   computer codes so Gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign .  ^\n\nTalk about whacked-out patriotism .   ^\n\nMy objections to Swordfish are many .  ^\n\nThe body count is high  , but that is expected in a movie of this sort .  ^\n\nIt \'s   becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers  , police officers and government agents blown to bits .   ^\n\nAnother example is the family dynamics between Stanley  , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife .  ^\n\nStanley  , though having served time in prison for hacking  , is shown as a loving and caring father  , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl .  ^\n\nAudience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband \'s   adult films .   ^\n\nThus when she is found murdered late in the movie  , neither Stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve .  ^\n\nIn fact  , subconsciously  , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed .   ^\n\nThen there is the sequence involving one of Gabriel \'s   henchman holding a gun to the head of Stanley \'s   daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for Gabriel .  ^\n\nChildren as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich in recent films .   ^\n\nThere is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well .   ^\n\nYea  , it \'s   only make believe  , but that does n\'t   mean you have to tolerate it .   ^\n\nTravolta is cool  , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy Gabriel .  ^\n\nHis character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in Broken Arrow and Face/Off .   ^\n\nJackman looks dour through most of the proceedings .  ^\n\nHis only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database .  ^\n\nHis sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate .   ^\n\nHalle Berry is decorative and lovely as Gabriel \'s   assistant  , while Don Cheadle is given little to do as the head FBI agent hunting Gabriel .   ^\n\nSwordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in Gabriel .  ^\n\nViewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain .  ^\n\nAnd maybe that is the movie \'s   underlying flaw  : There is no real hero to speak of  , only those doing their upmost to survive .   ^\n\nAnd that is not enough .  ^\n\nThis is one Swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .

cv226_26692.txt,'Not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie.   ^\n\nEarlier this year , Nora Ephron wrote and produced one of the year \'s  least    likeable \" comedies \" called HANGING UP , featuring a bunch of annoying women    ( ironically , Lisa Kudrow played one in that film as well ) who barely have    time to care about anyone but themselves .^\n\nIck ... real sweet stuff .    ^\n\nBut  her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what John    Travolta went through earlier this summer , with a film entitled BATTLEFIELD    EARTH .^\n\nI seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated    the film , even if it was on a \" cheese \" factor , as everybody , and I mean    everybody  else ,  pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst    disasters of all time .^\n\nYipes ... another beauty .^\n\nSo what happens when you put    these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the    ever-versatile Lisa Kudrow ?^\n\nUhhhm , you guessed it ... not much .    ^\n\nIn order to escape major financial difficulties , a local weatherman    hooks up with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery .   ^\n\nBut as more and more people find out about their scheme , more and more    people demand a part of their winnings , and more and more problems arise .    ^\n\nSimply stated , I did n\'t  laugh once during this entire picture .^\n\nFor    a comedy , it offered me a few smiles , a bunch of nincompoops as characters ,    a miscast John Travolta hamming it up and Lisa Kudrow , in what can only    described  as  a \" sluttier \" version of her character of Phoebe on TV \'s     \" Friends \" .^\n\nThis film was not as disastrous as I thought it would be , but it    was pretty close .^\n\nThankfully , the clips of Travolta dressed up in goofy    outfits , dancing as the weatherman were left in the film \'s  trailer , and not    in  this final cut .^\n\nAnd not unlike the worst movie of the year so far ,    BEAUTIFUL , this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic , idiotic and    just  plain irritating characters in its cast .^\n\nForemost was Travolta \'s     character , who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the    entire movie .^\n\nAnd for me , the casting choice of John Travolta for this role    was just plain wrong .^\n\nHe did n\'t  fit the part .^\n\nI just saw him in GET SHORTY    the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role .^\n\nA cool ,    calculating roughneck with a certain hip , suave \" je ne sais quoi \" .^\n\nIn this    film , he looks like he \'s  trying to be funny , trying to be bad , trying to be    good .^\n\nWe \'re  not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least    in my case , I consider it a wrong choice in casting .    ^\n\nAdd that to Lisa Kudrow , boring us with yet another one of her patented    \" dumb blonde \" routines , but this time , dressed in sexier outfits .^\n\nMichael    Rapaport , stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who is n\'t  quite    up  at the same speed level as everyone else .^\n\nAnd a truckload of empty    comedic bullet shells , and you \'ve  got yourself an extremely quiet audience    anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize .^\n\nThe only real good    thing  that I could say about this film is that its story was actually    half-interesting and never really bored me .^\n\nI also liked Michael Moore \'s     perverted cousin character , and I loved , and I say it again , loved the    character that Bill Pullman played .^\n\nGive this dude his own movie !^\n\nHe played    a lazy cop , a man who tries everything not to do any real work .^\n\nHe fakes    injuries to get off duty , tries to avoid arrest situations so that he wo n\'t     have  to  fill out any forms ... now there \'s  a base of humor .^\n\nSadly , the    filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left    in the film .^\n\nAnd there \'s  not much else I can say about this movie , folks .^\n\nOn    the whole , it was lame , included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling    around in a pool of unfunny lines , and very little of interest for any    target audience .^\n\nBut get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy    cop played by Pullman and I \'m  there !

Jackson  )  , a mathematician who earned  his first doctorate at the age of 18  ; Ted Fielding ( Liev Schreiber  )  , an  astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien  technology  ; and Harold Barnes ( Peter Coyote  )  , the government operative  in charge of the mission .   ^\n\nTogether  , the five descend into the bowels of  the ocean  , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean  floor from which they will attempt to make first contact .       ^\n\nFor a while  , SPHERE had me fooled into thinking it was going to  take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation .   ^\n\nThe overall  scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the  revelation that the enormous craft is actually an American space ship  ,  apparently from the future  ) offer intriguing possibilities .   ^\n\nThen  , right  around the one-hour mark ( that \'s   the time to sneak into the theater next  door and check out whatever \'s   left of TITANIC  )  , the virtually non-stop  action begins  , and  , once it starts  , the script becomes superfluous .    ^\n\nThis might be acceptable if director Levinson generated some legitimate  tension  , but  , instead  , he relies on loud  , overbearing music  , strange  camera angles  , and quick cuts to make things  \" exciting .  \"   ^\n\nAdditionally  ,  because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in  anything penned by Crichton  , who \'s   more interested in technology than  people  )  , viewers do n\'t   develop much of a rooting interest .   ^\n\nIt makes  sitting through SPHERE a frustrating and pointless experience .       ^\n\nWhat about that A-list cast  ?   ^\n\nNot surprisingly  , the most energetic  performance is given by Samuel L.

cv232_16768.txt,'Shakespeare in Love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever    made for the silver screen.^\n\nIt is both humorous and romantic in a very    unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearlyand    and a half hours that it occupies .^\n\nThat is , however , not to say it is a good    film , a quality production or anything of the sort .^\n\nShakespeare in Love is    an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality    or original work .    ^\n\nThe finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be    little  more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the    portrayal of people that we revere in our history books .^\n\nPhilip Henslowe    ( Geoffrey Rush ) ownsof thetheatres in London .^\n\nIt is at the peak of the royal    theatre  era ,  and Queen Elizabeth ( The recently Damed Judi Dench , by ,    appropriately enough , Queen Elizabeth II ) is very much a fan .^\n\nHowever , to    directly quote the film , he has \" cash flow problems . \"^\n\nThrough a long set of    events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next    show doing well enough to pay off his debts .    ^\n\nSo , Mr. Henslowe employs the young playwright , William Shakespeare ( Joseph    Fiennes ) to pen a comedic production .^\n\nHowever , the young writer has a severe    case of writer \'s  block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is    struggling as well .^\n\nHe has the title in mind , Romeo and Ethel , The Pirate \'s     Daughter ( Even that joke loses steam after a while ) but ca n\'t  seem to put    words to paper .^\n\nThen , as only Hollywood could have it , through a long set of    twisted events , he meets Viola De Lesseps ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) and falls madly    in love , thus curing his writer \'s  block .^\n\nThere are many other little issues    that Mr. Henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about    nothing .    ^\n\nThe first realization that I reached in watching this film is that one of    the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it \'s     author .^\n\nIronically , that could n\'t  be truer here .^\n\nThe great scenes that will    sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the    recitals of Shakespearean lines by actors playing actors .^\n\nOne of the most    breathtaking  moments  in  this film does not involve the character of    Shakespeare or Queen Elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but ratheryoung    children named Romeo and Juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name    of love .^\n\nSo it is that I am offended by the fact that Marc Norman and Tom    Stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name William    Shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character \'s  name in the credits .    ^\n\nThe acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point    that it would not have survived even in Queen Elizabeth \'s  theatres .^\n\nJoseph    Fiennes may just be the worst of fall though .^\n\nHe is tragically unbelievable    and comically bad .^\n\nGwyneth Paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her    lead position as well .^\n\nHowever , the supporting cast does almost save the    day . ^\n\nGeoffrey  Rush  is nothing short of incredible and Judi Dench is    breathtaking .^\n\nThey both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could    survive  in  this  film  of weak links .^\n\nYou will also find a very good    performance by Ben Affleck in his first real role since Good Will Hunting    ( No , Armageddon does n\'t  qualify as real acting. ) .^\n\nAnd Rupert Everett was    cute in his small part as well .^\n\nBut not even they could save this sad excuse    for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances .    ^\n\nWhen all is said and done , Shakespeare in Love is only worth the trip if you    want  to  be  entertained .^\n\nHowever , as the film so kindly pointed out ,    entertainment  may  be fun , but it is n\'t  necessarily quality .^\n\nAnd this    certainly is n\'t  quality .^\n\nPerhaps this may be best compared to a John Grisham    novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work .   ^\n\nSimply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining .    ^\n\n'

cv237_20635.txt,'There is a scene early in JAKOB THE LIAR that hints at how much better it    could have been .^\n\nThe scene is set in a Jewish ghetto in Poland circa 1944 ,    where a one-time cafe proprietor named Jakob Heym is walking resolutely    through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets .^\n\nTo one side of him ,    residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , German troops    beat a group of Jews .^\n\nJakob , however , never stops moving .^\n\nIt \'s  an efficient ,    effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody \'s  idea of a hero    at  the  outset . ^\n\nHe  is  a man who has responded to the horror of his    surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision .    ^\n\nThe set-up is critical because fate will turn Jakob into a reluctant savior .   ^\n\nAfter a visit to a German commandant \'s  office and a moment alone with a    turned-on radio , Jakob learns that Russian troops are quite near .^\n\nWhen he    brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow Jews , they become    convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the    ghetto .^\n\nThe good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of    suicide vanishes .^\n\nA private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened    with  creating  stories  of Russian military progress just to keep his    neighbors alive .    ^\n\nThis  promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is    burdened from the outset by casting : the \" ordinary person \" in question ,    Jakob Heym , is played by Robin Williams .^\n\nI am of the depressing opinion that    Williams is growing less assured as an actor in his \" serious \" roles with    every passing year .^\n\nCompare his dramatic scenes in THE WORLD ACCORDING TO    GARP and MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON with WHAT DREAMS MAY COME or PATCH ADAMS , and    see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much    less sensible at choosing material ) .^\n\nJAKOB THE LIAR depends on the notion    that Jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but Williams always looks    like he \'s  struggling _not_ to craft them .^\n\nWhen he improvises a radio address    by Winston Churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan Lina ( Hannah Taylor    Gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky .    ^\n\nOh yes , and then there \'s  that little girl .^\n\nSome viewers will undoubtedly    consider the hero \'s  fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of    LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL , but those scenes are n\'t  problematic because they \'re     familiar .^\n\nThey \'re  problematic because they \'re  jarring and distracting ,    introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that should n\'t  have been about    cutesy relationships .^\n\nJakob \'s  character arc may be about his willingness to    act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor    little Lina .^\n\nEvery scene with her feels contrived , pulling JAKOB THE LIAR    away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people .    ^\n\nIt is a pleasant surprise to find that JAKOB THE LIAR is a much grittier    production than you might expect from a Hollywood-ized Holocaust , combining    the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways .^\n\nDirector    Peter Kassovitz , working from Jurek Becker \'s  novel , crafts some nice scenes    between Jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from    Armin Mueller-Stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and Bob Balaban ( as a barber    drifting into depression ) .^\n\nThere are just too many things going on that    prove distracting , whether it \'s  the sketchy romanctic angle involving Liev    Schreiber  as  an earnest former prizefighter , or Williams \' incongrous    presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl .^\n\nJAKOB THE LIAR    deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling    a central character to waste .^\n\nAnd after one wonderful early scene , you can    see the film wasted and fumbled away . \n'

cv243_22164.txt,'I read the NEW YORKER magazine and I enjoy some of their really in-depth    articles  about  some  incident.^\n\nThey will take some incident like the    investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in    detail .^\n\nIt becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how    theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are    under , and just about any other aspect you can think of .^\n\nFrequently I get    the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but I am being told in more    detail than I really wanted to know .^\n\nOften I get to the middle of a story    and say , OK , it sounded good but I now have invested more time than I am    willing to spend on this subject .^\n\nFilm is a different medium .^\n\nIt is a visual    medium . ^\n\nThat  slows down the telling of stories much more than people    realize .^\n\nI frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is    and how much of the pages are empty space .^\n\nThe magazine article and the film    script are two very different media .^\n\nTHE INSIDER is a film adaptation of the    Vanity Fair article \" The Man Who Knew Too Much \" by Marie Brenner .^\n\nIt is too    much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film .^\n\nIt    really verges on being tedious at least at times .    ^\n\nFor years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug    that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects .^\n\nBut they pretended for the    public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it .^\n\nThe business    was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political    power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco .   ^\n\nThe tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was    convinced by the CBS 60 Minutes News team to tell the public how much the    tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking .^\n\nThe    resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at CBS .^\n\nWho    were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story    almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ?^\n\nThat is the story covered in    surprising detail by THE INSIDER .^\n\nThis all could have been enthralling , but    it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like Michael Mann would be likely    to do well .^\n\nAnd in the end , he failed .^\n\nTo make a long story short , the film    needed a director who knew how to make a long story short .    ^\n\nThe film opens with the CBSMinutes team in Iran with the assignment to    interview a terrorist .^\n\nWe get a taste for their personal style and how they    get the upper hand .^\n\nThey go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands    of the terrorists to the actual interview with Mike Wallace ( played by    Christopher Plummer ) .^\n\nThere the news team under producer Lowell Bergman ( Al    Pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it .^\n\nThis    seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when    the  tobacco  industry  is so much harder to manipulate than committed    terrorists ,  we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world .   ^\n\nTerrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real    position of power .    ^\n\nIncongruously intercut with the Iran interview sequence we see Jeffrey    Wigand  ( Russell Crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home .^\n\nWe    discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt    unexpectedly .^\n\nHe had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in    charge or research and development at Brown and Williams Tobacco ; now he was    unemployed and needed money to support his family .^\n\nRather than support him    his wife Liane ( Diane Venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do    for income .^\n\nMeanwhile the 60 Minutes team trying to do a story on fires    started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand .^\n\nThey    offer  Wigand  $ 12,000  just to interpret the data .^\n\nWigand \'s  severance    agreement  swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco    dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms .^\n\nHe is    willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret    them for Bergman .^\n\nIn spite of the secrecy , Wigand \'s  former employers seem    immediately to know Wigand is talking toMinutes and he is warned off by    former boss Thomas Sandefur played Michael Gambon in an all too brief but    deliciously sinister role .^\n\nAnd so the game begins .^\n\nWigand is irate at his    negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to    his agreement and his former employer .^\n\nMeanwhile someone is playing very    rough with Wigand and his family .    ^\n\nThe film examines Wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are    caught between two powerful giants .^\n\nWigand has always wanted to make tobacco    safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out .^\n\nHe and his    family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco    industry that had never lost a legal fight .^\n\nAl Pacino is given top billing    but the Wigand family is the core of THE INSIDER .    ^\n\nThe story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail .^\n\nThe    film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience .^\n\nThe    musical score by Pieter Bourke , Lisa Gerrard , and Graeme Revell is one of    the worst in recent memory .^\n\nIt puts ominous chords under some scenes and    using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the    storytelling .^\n\nAlso disturbing is the casting of Christopher Plummer as Mike    Wallace .^\n\nPlummer and Wallace are such different types and Wallace is too    well-known for even so good an actor as Plummer to play him convincingly .    ^\n\nThis  film  might have been a really engaging experience under another    director \'s  control .^\n\nMichael Mann was the wrong person to helm this film and    THE INSIDER lacks intensity because of his style .^\n\nI rate it aon thetoscale    and aon the -4 to +4 scale .

Bencio (Toninho Oliveira), Harold Perrineau Jr.    (Monica Jones), Mark Feurerstein (Cliff Lloyd), John De Lancie (Alex, TV    station manager), Anne Ramsay (TV director), Ana Gasteyer (Claudia Hunter);    Runtime: 83; Fox Searchlight Pictures; 1999)     A sensuous romantic comedy, about as appealing as your average lightweight    TV sitcom.^\n\nThere is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished    out , its the kind of stuff I \'ve  seen before and was made nauseous by its    silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny .^\n\nThe film plans to exploit    the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star Penlope Cruz , who plays a    Brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her    preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who    ca n\'t  get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story .    ^\n\nPenlope was wonderful in Pedro Almodvar \'s  \" All About My Mother , \" but here    she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease    the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she    bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all    over her face .^\n\nThe best you can say about her , is that she \'s  not to blame    for this picture being so off .^\n\nThis exploitation of sex film without even    delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that    delivers what it says it will .    ^\n\nThe story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of    Isabella ( Cruz ) , who is born in Bahia , Brazil and learns to cook at an early    age from her parents \' cook .^\n\nTo cure her motion sickness , her parents tried    every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of    the sea for her cure .^\n\nShe is able to control it now as long as she does n\'t     drive a car , ride elevators , follow in dancing , and is the woman on top when    making love .^\n\nIn other words , she has to be in control of things .    ^\n\nIn her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho Latin    waiter , Toninho Oliveira ( Murilo Bencio ) and marries him .^\n\nThey open up a    successful restaurant , where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all    the credit for it , even though he \'s  a loafer .^\n\nOne night she catches him in    bed with another girl and decides to leave for San Francisco .^\n\nWe do n\'t  see    her in flight , so I ca n\'t  tell how she handled her motion sickness problem    --  unless she flew the plane .    ^\n\nShe visits her friend \'s  apartment Monica ( Harold Perrineau Jr. ) , who is a    cross-dresser , blending right into the San Francisco scene .    ^\n\nTo  cast  away  her  love  for the irresistible Toninho , she calls her    spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her    from ever loving him again .^\n\nHer luck changes when a local TV producer Cliff    ( Mark Feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking    class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live TV cooking    show .    ^\n\nYou can really write the script from here on by yourself ... as the despondent    Toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had , but things continue to    go bad for him : there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village ,    there is no chef to replace his wife , as the restaurant is about to close    for good .^\n\nSo he comes to San Francisco , figuring he can charm her again .^\n\nHe    brings along with him his guitar playing musicians , the ones he used when    courting her , when he serenaded her under her window .    ^\n\nHe sees his wife on TV with Monica as her sidekick , the yuppie TV producer    chasing after her , and sees that she is no longer charmed by him .^\n\nWhen he    sneaks on her TV show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and    him singing corny love songs to her , the ratings go up and he \'s  hired as a    regular on the show .^\n\nThe show gets so big , that the network honchos come    onboard , taking it national .^\n\nBut they want to change the ethnic flavor of    the show , get rid of Monica because he \'s  a freak , have Isabella cook with    Tabasco instead of the Brazilian peppers she uses , and they change her    ethnic dresses to low-cut Vanna White type of sexy dresses .^\n\nCliff , her    would-be boyfriend , acts creepy and sides with the network big-shots , even    though  he loved everything she did .^\n\nThese TV scenes were not only bad    stereotype scenes of TV honchos , they were revolting .^\n\nIt was an insult to    one \'s  intelligence .    ^\n\nI \'m  sure that I \'m  not spoiling the ending for anyone , when I tell you that    Toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks    her spell of loving him again .^\n\nIf the film was n\'t  terrible enough , Monica    and Cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers .^\n\nIt was    so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it .    ^\n\nThis film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in    this film , because it does n\'t  look or feel like an Almodvar film , the type    of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with    from above .^\n\nIts more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying    than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven .    ^\n\nDennis

cv251_23901.txt,'Let me just start this review off by saying I am a huge fan of professional    wrestling and have been for fifteen years .^\n\nI am not too fond of Ted Turner \'s     World Championship Wrestling , however , and I am even less fond of it now    after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight .    ^\n\nThe plot concerns two losers named Gordie Boggs ( David Arquette , aptly cast    as a neandrathal ) and Sean Dawkins ( Scott Caan ) who are so obsessed with    professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on WCW Monday    Nitro is something more than a flashy show .^\n\nWhen they finally get to see    their  hero ,  WCW World Champion Jimmy King ( played by Oliver Platt .^\n\nI    personally would have gotten a wrestler to play King ) , he ends up getting    screwed over by evil promoter Titus Sinclair ( A wasted Palitaliano , in a    role originally meant for real-life WCW President Eric Bischoff before he    was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows    Bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of Sinclair had his name    written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get    his title back .^\n\nWhen they find him , they discover in horror that Jimmy    King \'s  real life is nothing like it is on WCW TV .^\n\nKing is a drunken Atlanta    native rather than an English king .^\n\nAfter convincing King that they do n\'t     care that his persona is n\'t  real , Gordie and Sean sneak him back onto WCW    Monday Nitro , after which Sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel    cage  match  for  the WCW title and his job back in Las Vegas at WCW \'s     pay-per-view .    ^\n\nGee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , I do n\'t  know    where to begin .^\n\nYes , I do  ...    ^\n\n1 . ^\n\nThe characters of Gordie and Sean show you what Eric Bischoff , WCW    President who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans .^\n\nHe thinks    of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously .^\n\nHe actually    thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken    seriously .^\n\nI got news for you , Eric : NOBODY above the age of four is dumb    enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 !^\n\nI know he \'ll  probably    cover arguments up by saying it is n\'t  meant to be taken seriously but it is ,    because that \'s  how big an ego Bischoff has .^\n\n2 .^\n\nThere was a documentary made    in 1998 , Wrestling with Shadows , that documented the owner of the World    Wrestling Federation , Vince McMahon \'s  screwing Bret \" The Hitman \" Hart out of    the title .^\n\nThis movie \'s  storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot    with the poor man \'s  Wayne and Garth thrown in .^\n\nEric Bischoff is trying to    make Vince McMahon look bad with the character of Titus Sinclair , but any    wrestling fan knows Titus is more like Bischoff than McMahon , and that Vince    did what he had to do to Bret Hart .^\n\n3 .^\n\nThe movie \'s  main wrestler , Jimmy    King , has an English king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him .^\n\nNo    wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we    want bad asses today !^\n\n4 .^\n\nWhy make this a comedy , instead of an emotional ,    ROCKY-style drama ?^\n\nI know wrestling is n\'t  a sport , but you can still get    behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end .^\n\n5 .   ^\n\nIn the movie , Gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with Nitro Girl Sasha    ( the lovely Rose McGowan .^\n\nWhat she sees in that freak Marilyn Manson I \'ll     never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized King \'s  trainer for    Sinclair . ^\n\nWould n\'t  it have been easier to just have them fall in love    instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ?^\n\nI hate that .   ^\n\n6 .^\n\nLast , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this    movie that I could not predict would happen , nor did I laugh once either .    ^\n\nThe World Wrestling Federation should have been the wrestling company to    make the movie , for these reasons :     1 .^\n\nThey \'re  the better promotion .^\n\n2 .^\n\nThey have better and younger talent ,    performers and wrestlers .^\n\n3 .^\n\nThey give their fans what they want and do n\'t     treat them like idiots .^\n\n4 .^\n\nThey \'re  winning the ratings and they \'re  the    promotion everybody cares about .^\n\n5 .^\n\nSimply put , they could make a movie a    hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way .    ^\n\nThe only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end .   ^\n\nAnd if I spoiled it for you , good , I saved you from wasting seven dollars .

  ^\n\nWell  , any hope a viewer may have had  , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist Dean Koontz or actor Mark Hamill  , will be dashed by the time he \'s   seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of WATCHERS REBORN .  ^\n\nThey \'re   awful .   ^\n\nThese commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called SHADOW DANCER  , some weird crap about a dead Indian  , teens  , and wolves  , and an  \" action  \" movie called DETONATOR starring Scott Baio .   ^\n\nScott Baio  !   ^\n\nWhat idiot dreamed this movie up  ?

Simon  , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic  : he walks slowly  , drawls his words  , kicks and screams when he \'s   touched  , and has a hard time looking at other people .  ^\n\nIt \'s   a difficult role for an adult  , much less a young child  , to play  , and unfortunately Hughes never convinces us that he is n\'t   playing like he \'s   autistic .  ^\n\nUnlike Dustin Hoffman \'s   performance in  \" Rain Man  \" or Leonardo DiCaprio \'s   in  \" What \'s   Eating Gilbert Grape  ,  \" we are always painfully aware that Hughes is acting .  ^\n\nHowever  , unlike  \" Rain Man  \" which used its character \'s   autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story  ,  \" Mercury Rising  \" could go right about its generic  , predictable plot with Simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid .  ^\n\nHell  , he does n\'t   even have to be shy .  ^\n\nIn fact  , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role  , rather than just being carted around under Willis  \' arm .  ^\n\nWillis  \' character  , Art Jeffries  , is a disillusioned FBI agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything .  ^\n\nHe becomes involved with Simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at Simon \'s   house  , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide .  ^\n\nOf course  , we know that is n\'t   the way it happened happen because we saw an evil  , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents .  ^\n\nSimon was able to get away  , and Jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet  , which the rest of the Chicago police department had overlooked .  ^\n\nJeffries --   who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it --   knows there is something more  , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect Simon .  ^\n\nThis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off Simon \'s   parents is crawling everywhere  , attempting to kill Simon at the hospital  , on the highway  , and every other place he goes .  ^\n\nLate in the movie  , Jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named Stacey ( Kim Dickens  ) who he meets at a coffee shop .  ^\n\nOf all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie  , this is the worst .  ^\n\nI can believe in the decency of the human heart  , but Stacey \'s   character is far too accommodating .  ^\n\nNot only does she agree to watch Simon while Jeffries runs off to solve the mystery  , she lets him into her apartment at two o\'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him  , and then lets him leave Simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent .  ^\n\nThe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point .  ^\n\nThe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences  , but even here  \" Mercury Rising  \" does n\'t   rise to the challenge .  ^\n\nThe movie was directed by Harold Becker  , who has made some good suspense films including  \" Sea of Love  \" ( 1989  ) and  \" Malice  \" ( 1993  )  , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion .  ^\n\nThere is one fight on a streetcar between Jeffries and another hitman ( played by Peter Stormare  ) that is so ineptly directed  , shot and edited  , that I had no idea 1  ) exactly where they were on the streetcar  , 2  ) who was hitting who  , and 3  ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where Jeffries and Simon were .  ^\n\nThe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building  , and features a harrowing ( yawn  ) scene where Simon walks along the very edge of the building  , not because he has to  , but because it \'s   more suspenseful that way .  ^\n\nTaken as a whole  ,  \" Mercury Rising  \" is an tepid  , confused movie that lacks style  , wit  , and any traces of a sense of humor .  ^\n\nUsually Willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles  , but here he is too straight and serious .  ^\n\nThis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time  , but it ends up failing on both fronts .  ^\n\nMaybe the book was better  , but the way it \'s   handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore  .'

cv261_11855.txt,'While the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation, we had    yet another shoddy, subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought    on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with    everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks.^\n\nAnd ,    once again , we have one of the worst films of the year .    ^\n\nThe trend of the moment --  and bear in mind it \'s  a trend not a movie - is    SPAWN ,  and if you \'ve  seen the animated series on HBO you \'ll  recall it    embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired    the ultimate punishment : He \'s  been sent to hell .^\n\nTodd McFarlane , the creator    of the SPAWN comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through SPAWN ,    for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were    all  being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over    substance , ambience over anything else .    ^\n\nNot only does SPAWN rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a    bewildered individual who must take on a group of bad guys and find himself    in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes    indigestible  after a while .^\n\nEvery character in this film is lifeless ,    vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student .    ^\n\nThe story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man    living  an  idyllic life .^\n\nAl Simmons ( Michael Jai White ) , a government    agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , Wanda ( Theresa Russell  ) and    daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , Terry ( D.B Sweeney ) and is    content with the job his boss , Jason Wynn ( Martin Sheen ) , provides him .    ^\n\nThe  next  element in the film is the part when things go awry .^\n\nAnd as    expected , everyone turns the tables on poor Al .    ^\n\nAs the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological    weapons plant , Al is befriended by Jason , and dies in a gory and truly    sickening scene .^\n\nInevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has    passed away .^\n\nHence , Jason \'s  mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the    world \" is just commencing its initial stages , when Al makes a pact with    Satan himself , agreeing to command the Devil \'s  army to take over the world    and he gets to see his family again .    ^\n\nSo , our pal Al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from    normal guy to Spawn takes place , his ol\' partner Terry forms a relationship    with his wife .^\n\nTime passes .^\n\nAnd now Spawn is present in the grotesque inner    city , the ghetto where Cog ( Nicol Williamson  ) teaches Spawn how to utilize    his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc  ...^\n\nThis character is merely a    poor man \'s  Obi Wan Kenobi without all the mythological hoopla .    ^\n\nNow the stage is set Spawn , the new `enemy of evil\' Vs Evil .^\n\nAnd evil takes    the cake , doubtlessly .^\n\nJohn Leguizamo \'s  deliciously heinous performance as    the injurious clown working for Wynn is the film \'s  relief point .^\n\nAll this    anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to    Leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is    basically a compilation of so-so one liners .    ^\n\nAnd then there \'s  Martin Sheen .^\n\nWhichever way you look you will find carving    boards  near  his  pitying and downright appalling last two years .^\n\nHis    selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent .^\n\nAs the megalomaniac    boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a B-movie , scrambled , and    left in the shelf to rot .^\n\nThis is the man that starred in films such as    APOCALYPSE NOW and WALL STREET .^\n\nI \'d  never thought I \'d  be saying this , but at    this juncture , Charlie Sheen \'s  career is in better shape .    ^\n\nSPAWN is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel    between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable .^\n\nFor most of    the film the vapid Michael Jai White consumes his time ogling , jumping    through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even    BATMAN AND ROBIN accomplished better .^\n\nIt constantly reminded us we were    watching a superhero movie --  a very bad superhero movie .^\n\nContinually the    film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures    are being made .^\n\nPerhaps no other movie better than SPAWN illustrates the    deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry .^\n\nThe filmmakers seem to    have forgotten every human element possible .^\n\nThe quality of this film is    abysmal and insulting .    ^\n\nIt  is  perceptible  that  director Mark Dippe , attempted to touch the    psychological chord that Tim Burton \'s  BATMAN DID touch , the desperation of a    man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act .^\n\nBut Bruce    Wayne  had  human elements to him .^\n\nHe was pensive , resourceful and had    relationships ,  which  made  our perspective on him equally human .^\n\nThe    character of Al Simmons seems to be LONGING for a drastic change , as if he \'s     fatigued about being normal .^\n\nAnd as all superheroes , Batman , Superman , The    Phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think    they are extraordinary .^\n\nNone of this is present in SPAWN .    ^\n\nThe fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful    and the art direction an odious duplicate of BLADE RUNNER \'S  .^\n\nAs an example    of this film \'s  vastly creative imagination the writers of SPAWN decided to    include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by    Spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic .^\n\nAdmittedly , I    did laugh once in the film ,and that \'s  when Todd McFarlane showed up in an    unexpected cameo as a bum .    ^\n\nIt is no wonder why so American children grow up with no engrossment for art    or literature .^\n\nBesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school    system , I condemn the other part to garbage like SPAWN .^\n\nMovies that present    no  admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what    children are being subjected to .^\n\nAnd kids will continue to see films like    SPAWN ,  simply  because they are unable to differentiate what makes an    imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one .^\n\nChildren are    not muppets .^\n\nAnd SPAWN unapologetically targets children .

cv263_20693.txt,'I suppose it\'s unfair to criticize a movie like Hudson Hawk, which has been    panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it\'s 1991 release.^\n\nMichael    Lehmann \'s  action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop    of all time\' , or close thereof .    ^\n\nThe movie stars Bruce Willis as renowned cat burglar Hudson Hawk , who \'s  just    been released from Sing Sing prison after many years in isolation ( `Let me    put it this way,\' he explains , `I never saw ET\' ) .^\n\nGreeting him is his old    friend  and partner in crime ( played by Danny Aiello ) , who becomes the    subject of many amusing fat jokes .^\n\nThese are rather welcome in a movie    filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and    unbelievable coincidences .^\n\nIt appears as if director Lehmann did n\'t  know    when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of    utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line .^\n\nIf    at  some  point during Hudson Hawk you make the assumption that things    could n\'t  get goofier , you \'ll  soon be eating your words .    ^\n\nBut , I \'m  inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it \'s  box    office numbers suggest .^\n\nIt \'s  fast-paced and entertaining , if you \'ve  got    incredible patience and a warped sense of humor .^\n\nFor the first portion of    this review , I \'m  going to try and center on the positive aspects of Hudson    Hawk .^\n\nWish me luck .    ^\n\nFirst and foremost : Bruce Willis is a good sport .^\n\nWhile I \'m  not entirely    sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , Willis is quite aware    that  the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke .^\n\nHe constantly gives    deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which    means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions .    ^\n\nAnother plus is the appearance of Andie MacDowell as a schizophrenic nun and    love interest for the title character .^\n\nThey meet when Hudson goes on a    mission to steal a priceless book from the Vatican , and their relationship    escalates in interest from there .^\n\nIt \'s  unfortunate that McDowell \'s  one-note    character  is  used  just  as  an excuse for there to be a predictable    plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with Willis .   ^\n\nBut now I \'m  rambling on again about the negative things , are n\'t  I ?    ^\n\nEnough of the charade - for the most part , Hudson Hawk is an excruciating    experience .^\n\nIt \'s  stupid , pointless and repetitive .^\n\nI can only wonder what    Bruce Willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film    really does n\'t  have the potential to please anyone .^\n\nAction fans should take    note  that  Hudson Hawk is composed of 90 \% comedy , and even the action    sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited .^\n\nAnd those expecting a    hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the    headache-inducing hi-jinks .^\n\nDo n\'t  get me wrong , this film is not devoid of    laughs .^\n\nIt \'s  too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced .    ^\n\nThe impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed .^\n\nIt \'s  understandable to see    Willis and Aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of    future Academy Award winner James Coburn I \'m  not entirely sure .^\n\nCoburn plays    a former nemesis of the Hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure    of his place the entire movie .^\n\nEspecially when he resorts to martial arts    during the final showdown , and has a fight with Willis that would look right    at home in a Jackie Chan film .^\n\nThings get more bizarre when we \'re  introduced    to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future NYPD    Blue star David Caruso as the speechless , card-flipping Kit-Kat .^\n\nIf that \'s     not enough for you , there \'s  Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernhard hamming it    up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover .   ^\n\nTheir crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here .^\n\nWait ,    maybe the only big laughs  ...    ^\n\nI \'m  not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming Hudson    Hawk .^\n\nI ca n\'t  even begin to start about the film \'s  absurd plot ; but let \'s     not get into that .^\n\nI suppose there \'s  some amusement viewers could derive    from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate .^\n\nBut Hudson Hawk    never even has a clue of where it \'s  going from minute one , and from there    it\'sminutes of pure cinematic muck .    ^\n\n'
cv264_14108.txt,'If there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film  , it was Studio 54  , the late Steve Rubell \'s   infamous New York discotheque  , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era \'s   heyday  : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone  , all set to a thumping dance beat .   ^\n\nSo when Miramax started production on _54_ last year  , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began  : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself  , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( Mark Christopher  ) and starring some hot young talent ( Salma Hayek  , Neve Campbell  , newcomer Ryan Phillippe  , and Mike Myers in his dramatic debut  ) .  ^\n\nMy  , how easily does the worm turn .   ^\n\nHype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago  )  , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially Christopher  ) unhappy  , and the very likely possibility that Miramax would not screen the finished film for critics .   ^\n\nAt the last minute  , though  , Miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that Myers \'s   last name was misspelled on the invitation  , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes  ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed  , myself included .   ^\n\nAnd with good reason --  somehow  , some way  , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism   ... boring .  ^\n\nAlthough Christopher has distanced himself from the finished film  , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_\'s   lifelessness.  _54_ focuses  , for the most part  , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club  : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva Anita ( a wasted Hayek  )  ; her busboy husband  , Greg ( Breckin Meyer  )  ; and  , most prominently  , the fresh-from-Jersey Shane O\'Shea ( Phillippe  )  , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender .   ^\n\nThese characters are about as generic as those descriptions .  ^\n\nIn focusing on the hired help  , Christopher really missed the boat .   ^\n\nWith the exception of the flamboyant  , always-woozy Rubell ( Myers  , in a well-modulated turn  )  , the meaty stories to be told at Studio 54 are not the workers  \' but those of the people who went there to party  ; not necessarily the numerous VIP guests  , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club \'s   famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things  ) the night away with the rich  , famous  , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of Ellen Dow \'s   feisty Dottie  , a disco- and drug-crazed granny  , but she \'s   a peripheral character at best  ) .   ^\n\nAs such  , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots  , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ .   ^\n\nWhat is a disco film --  especially one about the pinnacle of the movement --  without the dancing  ?   ^\n\nEven Whit Stillman \'s   _The_Last_Days_of_Disco_  , which was n\'t   so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies  , featured at least one extended dance scene .  ^\n\nDancing is n\'t   the only thing glazed over in _54_ --  so is the sex  , but that may not be entirely Christopher \'s   fault .   ^\n\nFrom what I \'ve   heard  , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring  , starting with the Shane character  : he was conceived ( and actually filmed  ) as a wild  , morally ambiguous bisexual  , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of Studio 54 \'s   legend .   ^\n\nBut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut  , Shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out  ; consequently  , so was the film .   ^\n\nAside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film  , Shane \'s   fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite Billie ( Sela Ward  )  , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage  , the sexual dimension is just about ignored .   ^\n\nShane  , in this incarnation  , is sanitized to the point of blandness  , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club  , Julie Black ( Campbell  )  , a worldly soap star with  , yes  , a heart of gold .   ^\n\nThis tacked-on  \" romance  \" would have been slightly less tedious if either Campbell or Phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience .   ^\n\nThey fail on both counts .  ^\n\nUltimately  , _54_\'s   failure comes down to three letters  : F-U-N . ^\n\nAs in  , there is n\'t   any to be had for the audience .   ^\n\nToo much time is spent with the boring Shane  , and too little is spent on the club floor  , where all the action took place .   ^\n\nAnyhow  , though  , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively .   ^\n\nWhen Anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club  , it should be a euphoric height  , for her  , the crowd  , and the audience  ; however  , the moment does n\'t   get a chance to reach that level  , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality  , which also mars the film \'s   conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots  ) .  ^\n\nStrangely upbeat and wistful  , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying .  ^\n\nThere is an interesting portrait of Studio 54 out there --  two of them  , in fact --  but _54_ is not one of them .   ^\n\nThey \'re   on cable TV  : a couple of documentaries produced by E  ! and VH1 .   ^\n\nThese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there \'s   still a great disco movie to be made .   ^\n\nThe problem is  , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_  , the subject may have run its Hollywood course .

Marley ( Robert Forster  )  , his new second officer Nick Vanzant ( James Spader  )  , head medical officer Kaela Evers ( Angela Bassett  )  , medical technicians Yerzy Penalosa ( Lou Diamond Phillips  ) and Danika Lund ( Robin Tunney  )  , and computer technician Benj Sotomejor ( Wilson Cruz  ) .  ^\n\nThere are some attempts at  \" characterization  ,  \" but all that means is that Nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction  , which puts Kaela on edge  , Yerzy and Danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes  , and Benj ( apparently gay  ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female  ) .  ^\n\nDo n\'t   expect any more explanation  , because you wo n\'t   get it .  ^\n\nAnyway  , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent .  ^\n\nDuring the dimension jump ( I think that \'s   what it \'s   called  , but do n\'t   hold me to it  )  , the Captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( Peter Facinelli  ) is brought on board .  ^\n\nHe calls himself Troy Larson  , making him the supposed son of a man Kaela once had a relationship with .  ^\n\nThen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening .  ^\n\nHave you seen  \" Alien  ?  \"  ^\n\nHave you seen  \" Event Horizon  \" ( a lame movie in its own right  )  ?  ^\n\nGood .  ^\n\nThen you \'ve   seen  \" Supernova .  \"  ^\n\nPost-production cuts or not  , there is nothing original about this screenplay  , and nothing unpredictable either .  ^\n\nAfter all  , no one \'s   going to think for a second that Troy wo n\'t   turn out to be a villain .  ^\n\nBut the bigger problem with  \" Supernova  \" is that it can \' t just stick to the simple plot it \'s   afforded .  ^\n\nNumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people  , but it \'s   a gross underestimate  ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped .  ^\n\nWas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot  ?  ^\n\nDid the ship \'s   computer learn something about humanity  ?  ^\n\nWhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact Troy brought on board with him  ?  ^\n\nAnd just what does the film \'s   title signify  , if anything  ?  ^\n\nAs far as I can tell  , it refers to a very small plot detail that is n\'t   developed  , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements .  ^\n\nCharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense .  ^\n\nFor some reason  , every person in this film keeps having sex .  ^\n\nWe get an unusually early sex scene between Phillips and Tunney within the first 10 minutes .  ^\n\nBassett and Spader \'s   characters start off hating each other .  ^\n\nFifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later  , they \'re   engaging in some hanky-panky .  ^\n\nWhen Troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship  , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him .  ^\n\nEvery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly  , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut .  ^\n\nThe most prominent example  , however  , may be the fact that when the film starts  , there are no opening credits  !  ^\n\nFurthermore  , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits .  ^\n\nMaybe that \'s   why the film \'s   title is mentioned twice during the end credits  , right between James Spader and Robert Forster .  ^\n\nRight after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you \'re   seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery  )  , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene  , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations .  ^\n\nThe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know  , where they explain things  ) and just went from Point A to Point B. Point A  : Danika is thoroughly enamored of Yerzy and is ready to have his baby .  ^\n\nPoint B  : Tunney is now shagging Troy and Yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing .  ^\n\nDoes n\'t   make sense .  ^\n\nSince I did n\'t   understand anything about these characters  \' motivations  , did I care when Troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does  , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes  )  ?  ^\n\nNot a whit .  ^\n\nIt \'s   a shame  , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do .  ^\n\nThey do n\'t   find it .  ^\n\nBassett and Spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces .  ^\n\nSexual tension  ?  ^\n\nMore like constipation .  ^\n\nMaybe they \'re   just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as  \" This thing was made by someone more powerful than God and a whole lot less nice .  \"  ^\n\nNot that we ever find out who that is  , mind you .  ^\n\nThe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod  ) is probably the film \'s   biggest forehead-slapper .  ^\n\nAs Troy  , Peter Facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected .  ^\n\nHe \' s awfully one-note  , but it \'s   not as if he \'s   given any more notes to work with .  ^\n\nThe rest of the cast does even less .  ^\n\nTunney stands around looking cute  , then scared .  ^\n\nPhillips broods .  ^\n\nCruz flirts with the computer .  ^\n\nThen they all die and a star blows up or something  , but I really was n\'t   paying much attention by then .  ^\n\n\" Supernova  \" is pretty awful  , but I \'m   cutting it a little slack merely because I expected less than what I got .  ^\n\nThat \'s   it .  ^\n\nIf you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have  )  , you \'ll   probably hate it more than I will .  ^\n\nEven the special effects are fairly unimpressive  , nothing you haven \' t seen before  , and suffice to say the script is n\'t   going to save the film .  ^\n\nHonestly  , though  , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym  ?  ^\n\nIt usually results in a bad movie  , and that \'s   what  \" Supernova  \" is  .'

cv271_15364.txt,'The obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is    to acquire continued profits.^\n\nThe rationale is sound , but in many cases of    this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that \'s  exposed for the    cash-milking vehicle it really is .^\n\nLast year \'s  SPEED 2 and SCREAM 2 , as well    as this year \'s  SPECIES II have all been products that have been decisively    less than satisfactory .^\n\nIn some cases , a sequel can even discredit its    predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID    LAST SUMMER .^\n\nWhatever uniqueness the original might \'ve  had now seems trite    and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller .    ^\n\nJulie James ( Jennifer Love Hewitt ) and Ray Bronson ( Freddie Prinze Jr. ) are    back from the original to star in I STILL KNOW , reprising their roles in    typical fashion .^\n\nJulie and Ray experience a rather predictable falling-out    at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer Will    Benson ( Matthew Settle ) .^\n\nWill and Julie hit it off , and along with friends    Karla ( Brandy Norwood ) and Tyrell ( Mekhi Phifer ) , the foursome heads off to    a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics .^\n\nUnfortunately , things    are n\'t  so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your    watch by , the infamous fisherman ( Muse Watson ) is back with his hook .^\n\nIt \'s     another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending .    ^\n\nThere \'s  not much that \'s  original about I STILL KNOW , and with the market    saturated by Gen-X thrillers like this one , it \'s  unlikely that I STILL KNOW    will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel .^\n\nFor die-hard fans    of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is    that the material here is just recycled from the original I KNOW WHAT YOU    DID  LAST  SUMMER . ^\n\nThe aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot is n\'t     heightened  by  skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense ,    string-based score and manipulative editing .^\n\nThe man with the hook ends up    becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many    lines of dialogue --  he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few    short and painful moments .    ^\n\nMuch of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point .^\n\nThe whole    reason the plot exists - Julie and Karla must guess the capital of Brazil in    order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening    suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem .^\n\nAnd , whereas the    killer \'s  identity might \'ve  been a question in the first movie , it \'s  almost a    given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically .^\n\nThree or    four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly    refer to as \" the killer . \"^\n\nThey \'re  almost used to it , and the performances    show it - not Hewitt , nor Prinze , nor Brandy , nor Phifer give a decent show .   ^\n\nAnd so , in the end , it \'s  left wide open for a third movie and - most likely    - a brand new supporting cast .^\n\nGod help us . \n'

Runtime: 100; Castle Hill Productions; 1998-USA /    Belgium / Netherlands)     A film that means well, but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point    and  too  sentimental to be compelling as a drama.^\n\nIt \'s  Jeroen Krabb \'s     melodrama about a community of Jews in Antwerp in 1972 who ca n\'t  forget    their bitter past .^\n\nThe heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious    20-year-old , Chaja ( Fraser ) , who wants to forget her Jewish roots by getting    involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and    living with her Gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( Sgebrecht ) and    her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( Schell ) .^\n\nHer parents are survivors of    the Holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst .   ^\n\nHer mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking    soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is    more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two    suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old    violin .^\n\nHe buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the Nazis ,    but ca n\'t  locate them now due to all the changes in the city .    ^\n\nOut  of  frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing    eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with    an Hasidic couple that an old man in her parents \' apartment building , Mr.    Apfelschnitt ( Topol ) , tells her about .^\n\nThe Hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they    do n\'t   go to the cinema or watch TV , adhere to strict dress codes , and    strictly observe their religious laws .    ^\n\nChaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules ,    but  soon finds the wife , Mrs. Kalman ( Rossellini ) , to be kind and she    becomes attached to one of herchildren , a 4-year-old named Simcha ( Monty )    who does n\'t  talk .^\n\nThe stern Mr. Kalman ( Krabb ) is not friendly to her and    considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses .    ^\n\nTo hammer home the point of how anti-Semitism has n\'t  gone away there \'s  a    barrage  of  overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering Concierge    ( Bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about Jews and tries to make    things inconvenient for them by preventing the Jewish family from using the    elevator .    ^\n\nThe film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from Carl    Friedman \'s  book \" The Shovel And The Loom , \" goes from one false note to    another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality .^\n\nIt starts    off telling Chaja \'s  story of how she \'s  a lost Jewess trying to find her    identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an    insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering    effects  of the bitter past that ca n\'t  be forgotten .^\n\nThe effort seemed    heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it    ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters .    ^\n\nThe supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a    cartoonish flavoring : Chaja \'s  parents are given no human shades , while the    janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional    and falsely acted .    ^\n\nThe only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were    Fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she    was going through and the joys she felt --  but most admirably showing how    she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while    Rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is    strong in accepting her faith .^\n\nTopol \'s  reassuring performance as the wise    man who says all the right things to Fraser , acts as the true voice of the    filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense .    ^\n\nThe film brazenly uses little Simcha to get across its agenda of pointing    out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it ca n\'t  love : it starts out    by showing how under Chaja \'s  loving care he \'s  taken to the duck pond and    soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying \'quack , quack\' and then    going on to ask the four questions during a Passover seder .^\n\nBut by showing    how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in    his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually    becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy \'s     sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done .    ^\n\nI felt I did n\'t  just see a movie , but I attended a lecture for the whole 100    minutes of this serious but unappetizing story .^\n\nIt was the kind of movie    that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of    rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily -- the message it keeps sending was    already received .^\n\nIn the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly    digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film    learned anything about themselves or the past .^\n\nThat seems strange , since I    thought that was what this film was supposed to be about .^\n\nUnless I was    mistaken and the film \'s  real aim was to make us cry over Simcha .    ^\n\nDennis Schwartz : \" Ozus \' World Movie Reviews \"     ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ '

 !  ^\n\nIt \'s   totally absurd   ... and this is the screenwriter of Seven  ?  ^\n\nLate in the film there \'s   a confrontation between all the main characters  , and after a struggle one of the character \'s   guns ends up underneath a car .   ^\n\nCage  , who has been handcuffed to a bed  , is rapidly trying to get to his gun  , which is on a table .   ^\n\nJames Gandolfini \'s   character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of  \" suspense  \" .   ^\n\nYou see  , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he \'s   trying to reach it from  , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it  ) he just keeps stretching .   ^\n\nGO AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR  !  !   ^\n\nThis goes on for minutes .   ^\n\nThen  , after Cage gets his gun  , Gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car .   ^\n\nBoy  , Schumacher is really really getting on my nerves .   ^\n\nI think the final straw would be when Cage returns home  , devastated by everything that he \'s   seen on this case  , and then IS NO LONGER ABLE TO RAKE HIS LAWN  !   ^\n\nWe actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard .  ^\n\nOther things that bugged me about 8MM  : One would be the music  , if you can call it that .   ^\n\nWhenever the score starts up  , it sounds like techno music  , and then this awful Indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it .   ^\n\nAwful decision there Joel .   ^\n\nAnother is Cage \'s   performance .   ^\n\nAt this point he \'s   capable of a wide range of performances  , either good or bad .   ^\n\nFor 8MM  , he delivers a very wooden one  , and only shines when he \'s   interacting with Joaquin Phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps Cage with his case  ) .   ^\n\nYou \'re   capable of much better Mr. Cage .   ^\n\nNow as for you Mr.  Schumacher   ...  ^\n\nI \'m   starting to doubt if you \'re   capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of American cinema .

cv281_24711.txt,'The great actor James Woods once said (and I\'m paraphrasing), \"If sex isn\'t    messy, then you\'re not doing it right\".^\n\nA truly profound statement , and one    that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace \" sex \" with    \" your mad slasher film \" ) .^\n\nFor those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre    ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the    service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but    always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la HALLOWEEN .    ^\n\nURBAN LEGEND is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless ,    and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though    not  overly  talented )  cast , it more closely resembles an overlong WB    television special .^\n\nFor film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they    have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as Stephen King    once said ( again paraphrasing ) \" If you ca n\'t  scare your audience , gross em\'    out , if you ca n\'t  do that , make em\' laugh \" .^\n\nAlas , URBAN LEGEND succeeds only    at the latter , though not by intention .^\n\nI actually find the fact that this    film became a minor success ( $ 40 million domestic box office gross ) more    frightening than anything in it .^\n\nIt seems that audiences \' tastes have been    whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is    given the benefit of the doubt .^\n\nThe promotion for URBAN LEGEND sure promised    thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit IQ argue that it provides    them .^\n\nUnfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced    because  people  no  longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped    blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point    where films do n\'t  need to do anything more than promise a good time without    the added pressure of delivering .^\n\nIf anyone disagrees I would love for them    to explain the box office successes of shit like BATMAN AND ROBIN , WILD WILD    WEST , and GODZILLA .    ^\n\nBut forget all that , it goes without saying that Mad Slasher films ( or any    other  exploitation  off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft    ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) .^\n\nAllow me to    present  you  with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of    enthusiastic exploitation .^\n\nThese flicks are n\'t  harnessed with any lofty    aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good    time ?^\n\nSadly out of the literally hundreds made , I would estimate that maybe    three  are at all worth while .^\n\nAnd URBAN LEGEND would certainly not be    included amongst those three .^\n\nDespite its considerable production value and    the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any    no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes .    ^\n\nAs far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation URBAN LEGEND \'s     setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : It takes place on    a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed    killer .^\n\nYou see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young    people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the    surface .^\n\nAll those young people are growing up together , going through all    kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness    is expected .^\n\nAll the better for that elusive crazed killer .^\n\nCoupled with the    copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction    of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy    task .^\n\nBut alas , URBAN LEGEND is not only idiotic and clich full ; it \'s  way    too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore ,    and much stupidity .^\n\nThis is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead    victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , I dunno ,    exercise . ^\n\nIt \'s   the  kind  of movie where the villain calmly purses a    running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through    some  really  awful  editing  techniques .^\n\nIt \'s  the kind of movie where    characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the    soundtrack . ^\n\nI  really  wish  filmmakers  would just retire that whole    loud-noise-jump-scare thing .^\n\nYes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened ,    but would n\'t  anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room .    ^\n\nI lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in URBAN LEGEND    about ten minutes in when I caught a glimpse of the killer .^\n\nApparently    filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers .   ^\n\nIn SCREAM it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST    SUMMER it was a fisher man \'s  rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) ,    and in URBAN LEGEND the disguise sinks to the level of Mel Brooks parody :    the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( oohscary ) intended to    conceal his/her identity .^\n\nFor URBAN LEGENDI humbly suggest a Donald Duck    costume .    ^\n\nThough I must admit , URBAN LEGEND does have a winning premise for what could    have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film .^\n\nThe film \'s  killer    slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends    ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find    that they \'re  coming from inside the house ) .^\n\nI wo n\'t  spoil the surprise as to    what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2:00 am    cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough .^\n\nSad to say , it does n\'t     include my favorite urban legend : A fairly graphic antidote concerning    Richard Gere and a very unhappy gerbil .^\n\nNow that would be scary .    ^\n\nBefore I leave you , I would like to bring to your attention the third most    irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the    second the lack of exploitation) --  its characters , all of whom are just    about the most annoying group of people I \'ve  ever spent an evening with .   ^\n\nOnly Jared Leto ( looking like a carbon copy of Rob Lowe from back in the    day ) and Alicia Witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness .^\n\nThe    most annoying of the bunch is a tie between Noxima girl Rebecca Gayheart and    sitcom star Michael Rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating    I  actually  cheered  his painful death , and I am not a cruel person ) .   ^\n\nIronically  those  aggravating  sacks  of human waste provide the only    entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy URBAN LEGEND can    be mildly entertaining .^\n\nAfter all this is a movie that features the kind of    faux hipsters I ca n\'t  stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better    than  watching  an  entire film about people I ca n\'t  stand not getting    slaughtered.

Evan Bonifant  )  , who quickly learns to become a mini-Elwood .  ^\n\nWhen bartender Mighty Mack McTeer ( John Goodman  ) joins the group  , the Blues Brothers Band is complete  , and once again  , the group travels the country  , crashing cars  , blowing things up  , and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock .  ^\n\nMeanwhile  , Cab \'s   personal vendetta against Elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next-to-next-of-kin. >From this point  , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between .  ^\n\nThose hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story .  ^\n\nOnly the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours .  ^\n\nFor those people  , it may be worth it  , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting  , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities  , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes  , musicians turned stiff actors  , and the pointless 10-year- old Buster attempting to add some sort of HOME ALONE cuteness to the whole thing .  ^\n\nAppearances by musical legends such as Aretha Franklin  , James Brown  , Eric Clapton  , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film  , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors .  ^\n\nBLUES BROTHERS 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really  , really love this kind of music  , you might kind of  , sort of like this movie .  ^\n\nMany  , many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny  , and if you do n\'t   have a passion for very deep blues/rock  , you \'ll   be bored out of your skull .  ^\n\nMuch of this film seems nothing more than Aykroyd \'s   self-serving vanity project  , but no matter how much fun Aykroyd may be having with this  , none of the excitement is passed on to the audience .  ^\n\nAnd seeing three guys in three-piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film .

cv284_20530.txt,'If  only  Austin  Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me had been just half as    original, zany, silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor, it would    have easily been one of this summer\'s biggest pleasures.^\n\nIf only .^\n\nIn fact ,    The Spy Who Shagged Me is the exact opposite of the original ; instead of    refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another , the filmmakers    bombard us with used-up , tired jokes taken directly from the first one .    ^\n\nTake the scene where Austin Powers ( again played by Mike Myers , but with    only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously ) confronts a    henchmen on the side of a cliff .^\n\nAfter being pushed off the ravine , the bad    guy is of course assumed dead .^\n\nBut suddenly , we hear a pleading voice coming    from down below ; he \'s  only injured .^\n\nA similar scene played very well in the    original International Man of Mystery , but here I was insulted by it .^\n\nDid    the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a rip-off ?    ^\n\nApparently I overestimated the intelligence of the average movie-goer ,    considering  that the film has pulled in over $ 200 million in domestic    theatrical grosses alone .^\n\nDo I hear the sound of a franchise heading our    way ?    ^\n\nHaving said that , though , I still cannot deny the film its merits .^\n\nThe basic    plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat ; Dr. Evil    ( Mike Myers , in the second of his three roles ) , having constructed a time    machine , goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch Austin Power \'s     \" mojo \" ( do n\'t  you just love that word ? ) whilst he is cryogenically frozen .   ^\n\nWhen Austin gets wind of this ( after a great intro explaining the absence of    Elizabeth Hurley \'s  Vanessa Kensington )  , he too travels back in time to    re-claim his sexual drive , accompanied by the hot-to-trot Felicity Shagwell ,    played by Heather Graham .^\n\nThis sounds stupid , I know , but in the movie it    starts to make some kind of weird , off-the-wall sense , and it worked for me .    ^\n\nThen there \'s  Mini-Me ( Verne Troyer ) , a  ... petite clone of Myer \'s  Dr. Evil ,    exactly in size .^\n\nTroyer \'s  persona alone gains the film an extra half-star ,    contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble    on his own Mini-Mr .^\n\nBigglesworth .^\n\nJust try to ignore the fact that , at    2\'8 \'\' , he would make Dr. Evil \'s  height rise to just over 21 feet .^\n\nNo matter .    ^\n\nHowever , there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour    and a half ( the most notable being the now infamous tent scene ) , and that    just is n\'t  enough to warrant even a minor recommendation .^\n\nIf there is in    fact an \" Austin Powers 3 \" , they should just kill off secret agent Powers and    put the emphasis on Dr. Evil and Mini-Me .^\n\nUnconventional , yes , but there \'s     no denying that it \'d  make for a better movie .    ^\n'
cv285_18186.txt,'In the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this French-Canadian co-production by Max Fischer .  ^\n\nThe movie is set in Paris where its hero  , struggling American author David Mirkine ( Judd Nelson  , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity  ) suffers a terrible writers bloc .  ^\n\nHe manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model Anabelle ( Laurence Treill  ) .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , she hangs out in jet set circles  , which gradually makes Mirkine pathologically jealous .  ^\n\nHer connection with powerful David Caravan ( Pierce Brosnan  ) would make Mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events .  ^\n\nAlthough few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller  , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label .  ^\n\nPacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers  , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments .  ^\n\nLow budget also becomes painfully visible  , and physical attributes of Laurence Treill are the only thing worth watching in this film .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes  , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed .  ^\n\nInstead  , they would have to settle with pointless  , slow scenes involving Nelson  , Brosnan and Laurence Treill \'s   attempts of serious acting .  ^\n\nAll of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone \'s   precious time .

cv293_29731.txt,'Starring Justin Chambers, Mena Suvari, Stephen Rea, Tim Roth, Catherine    Deneuve.^\n\nDirected by Peter Hyams .^\n\nRated PG-13 .    ^\n\nAlexander Dumas \' The Three Musketeers is one of the most often-adapted    literary works , and for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather    than just a story .^\n\nPerhaps The Musketeer , a new film that \" reimagines \" the    novel in the spirit and style of The Matrix , is one adaptation too many .   ^\n\nIt \'s  just awful : spiritless , silly and unforgivably boring , transforming the    timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clichs and incoherent ,    repetitive action sequences .    ^\n\nThis time , D\'Artagnan is played by Calvin Klein model Justin Chambers , who    ca n\'t  even pronounce his character \'s  name .^\n\nAs a boy , he watched his father    get killed by Febre ( Tim Roth ) , a lackey of power-hungry Cardinal Richelieu .   ^\n\nHe vowed to have vengeance .^\n\nAfter undergoing intense training under an    expert swordsman , he goes looking for his enemy .    ^\n\nOn his quest , he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest    levels of the French government .^\n\nThe Royal Musketeers have lost their gusto ,    what with their jobs being taken over by the Cardinal \'s  own guards .^\n\nOnly a    few loyal swashbuckers remain , among them Athos and Portos ( who are only    figureheads  in  this  movie ) .^\n\nTogether with D\'Artagnan , they fight to    extricate  the Queen ( Catherine Deneuve ) from the traps that Febre and    Richelieu are trying to plant .^\n\nOh , and as an afterthought , D\'Artagnan falls    in love with the poor maid at the local inn ( Mena Suvari ) .^\n\nJust thought I \'d     mention that .    ^\n\nNow , look : I do n\'t  know whose idea this was , but whoever is responsible    deserves a severe tongue-lashing .^\n\nI have nothing against \" modernizing \"    classic works of literature - at the very least , they can inspire viewers to    actually read the book - but films as dull as this have no positive side    effects .^\n\nDirector Peter Hyams , known for such masterpieces of modern cinema    as Timecop and End of Days , has jettisoned everything that was great about    Dumas \' masterwork : the sense of excitement , cause , and camaraderie .^\n\nInstead ,    we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous , uninvolving action    sequences  that  emerge  from  emptiness and lead to nothing .^\n\nWhen the    musketeers finally get to holler \" All for one , and one for all , \" I could    have sworn that was Dumas rolling in his grave that I felt .    ^\n\nMaybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the Hyams \'s  tone ,    which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the Reader \'s     Digest condensed version of the story that he gives us .^\n\nIt \'s  as though    anything that may have been construed as \" fun \" was purposely expunged from    the production .^\n\nThe joylessness of the proceedings , from the oppressively    shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes , can be felt in every frame .    ^\n\nChambers ca n\'t  act ; Suvari , Roth and Deneuve can , but are n\'t  given the    chance . ^\n\nAnd  when  push  comes  to shove , the use of stunt doubles is    distractingly obvious , though at least Roth gets to play a villain without    having to wear an ape suit .    ^\n\nSome movies seem sloppy and careless , clearly made for a quick buck .^\n\nWith    The Musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful .   ^\n\nThe film is intricate , stylish and precise , hitting the wrong note every    single time .

cv295_17060.txt,'When I first saw the preview for Cruel Intentions  , I turned to my friend and said  ,  \" Dangerous Liaisons for Kids  !  \"   ^\n\nIt was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense  , owing everything it is to Stephen Frears  \' 1988 masterpiece .   ^\n\nImagine my surprise to see that writer/director Roger Kumble has given credit to his source material  :  Choderlos de Laclos is recognized for his novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses in the opening credits .   ^\n\nAnd I was impressed .          ^\n\nIn fact  , I was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film  , which is an appalling excuse for a movie .   ^\n\nIt \'s   kiddie-porn hackwork  , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs .   ^\n\nI suppose this kind of movie was inevitable  ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out  , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they \'re   smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined .   ^\n\nCruel Intentions is a mess in every possible way  , and it fails primarily in the way I expected it to  :  I hated all the characters  , and I hate everything they do .            ^\n\nI also hate Ryan Phillippe  , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be .   ^\n\nPhillippe plays ( check out this name  ) Sebastian Valmont .   ^\n\nWow .   ^\n\nIs n\'t   that a memorable name  ?   ^\n\nI could just say it over and over again .   ^\n\nSebastian Valmont .   ^\n\nIt kind of rolls off the tongue  , in the spirit of phrases like Sanguine Vapors and Velvet Sandwich .   ^\n\nSebastian Valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth  ; there is no woman he ca n\'t   have  , no material object out of his reach .   ^\n\nHe has all the money  , all the sex --   all at his fingertips .   ^\n\nAnd  , luckily  , his parents never enter into his life --   no  , in the world of Cruel Intentions  , adults do n\'t   really exist .   ^\n\nThe ones who do are irritating .          ^\n\nSebastian Valmont lives with his stepsister  , Kathryn Merteuil ( Sarah Michelle Gellar  )  , the bitch-queen of the universe  , and also the woman every man wants .   ^\n\nSince these two rich kids are so bored  , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons .   ^\n\nKathryn wants Sebastian Valmont to de-virginize Cecile Caldwell ( Selma Blair  )  , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged Kathryn .   ^\n\nBut it \'s   too easy for Sebastian Valmont --   he wants to nail Annette Hargrove ( Reese Witherspoon  )  , the  \" paradigm of chastity and beauty .  \"   ^\n\nSo  , Sebastian Valmont and Kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here  ) .   ^\n\nBut --   dear God  ! --   Sebastian Valmont actually begins to fall for poor Annette Hargrove .            ^\n\nDangerous Liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable  , and because of its masterful acting .   ^\n\nCruel Intentions is bad for many reasons  , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting .   ^\n\nKathryn Merteuil is simply a hateful witch  , a girl so loathsome that I would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her .   ^\n\nShe is supposed to be mean  , but Glenn Close gave the character some depth in Dangerous Liaisons .   ^\n\nGellar  , while aesthetically pleasing  , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive .   ^\n\nWitherspoon has a truly beautiful face  , but her character is n\'t   the moral staple she \'s   supposed to be  :  sure  , she wo n\'t   have sex until she \'s   in love ( is this really a *moral* issue  ?  )  , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible .          ^\n\nBut I ca n\'t   forget Mr. Phillippe  , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable  , invulnerable blandness .   ^\n\nI have to give him credit and say that he did  , in fact  , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of Cruel Intentions .   ^\n\nAnd there \'s   one point in the film in which he shouts  , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone .   ^\n\nTrue  , he is bad  , but it does n\'t   help that he has no character to work with .   ^\n\nKumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character  , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch .           ^\n\nThe film fails in every other way  , too .   ^\n\nFirst of all  , nobody talks like this .   ^\n\nEven the  \" intellectuals  \" I know do n\'t   bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering .   ^\n\nFor a while  , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs  , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there \'s   no way we can join it .   ^\n\nCruel Intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene .   ^\n\nEarlier I mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job  ; this occurs between Kathryn and Sebastian Valmont  , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie .   ^\n\nSo  , if we hate them  , then what \'s   the point of an extended sex scene  ?   ^\n\nTitillation  , of course .   ^\n\nIt ca n\'t   even work under the pretense of  \" meaningful love scene  ,  \" because we hate the characters .          ^\n\nIt \'s   interesting to note some of the parallels between Cruel Intentions and Dangerous Liaisons .   ^\n\nKumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film  ; many of the scenes have a similar tone  , and there are moments in Frears  \' film that Kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene  , in which [ spoiler warning  !  ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers  ) .   ^\n\nBut kids do n\'t   act like this .   ^\n\nNobody acts like this .   ^\n\nIn his translation  , Roger Kumble forgot character development and sympathy --   some pretty crucial elements .   ^\n\nThe result is a picture of confounding badness  , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it \'s   really deep and profound .   ^\n\nI \'ll   give Cruel Intentions credit for realizing its influences  , but that does n\'t   change the fact that it \'s   awful .

cv299_17950.txt,'8mm  , written by Seven scribe Andrew Kevin Walker  , has an interesting idea which is ruined by Hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery .  ^\n\nNicolas Cage plays family man detective Tom Welles  , who is asked by upper class toff Mrs. Christian ( Myra Carter  ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe .  ^\n\nThe movie happens to be an mythical \' snuff movie \'  , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed .  ^\n\nAll Mrs. Christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not .  ^\n\nWelles agrees  , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies  , with video clerk Max California ( Phoenix  ) as his guide .  ^\n\nAlthough the \' snuff \' industry has n\'t   really been examined in mainstream cinema  , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most .  ^\n\nThe snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing  , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away .  ^\n\n8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much  , and apart from a few moments  , most of the action in the film is nothing you have n\'t   seen from another standard thriller .  ^\n\nThe cast help towards the entertainment  , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy Nicolas Cage .  ^\n\nWhile he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as Raising Arizona ( 1987  )  , ever since Leaving Las Vegas ( 1995  )  , Cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot  , such as in the terrible Snake Eyes ( 1998 .  )  ^\n\nHere  , in 8mm  , he \'s   boring  , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice .  ^\n\nAnd in this overlong thriller  , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up .  ^\n\nOnly when Cage is onscreen with the excellent Phoenix does the film start moving  , as Phoenix is a true talent .  ^\n\nHis performance is a great break away from the gloom  , and he \'s   just purely enjoyable to watch .  ^\n\nCatherine Keener is completely wasted as Cage \'s   wife  , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves .  ^\n\nHer character  , though  , is hugely underwritten  , one of the most wasted characters of the year .  ^\n\nAlso fun is Fargo \'s   Peter Stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director .  ^\n\nAs this film is written by the person behind Seven  , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom  , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch .  ^\n\nUnlike Seven  , 8mm is n\'t   too clever  , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives .  ^\n\nLacking the strong characters Seven featured  , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise  , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment .  ^\n\nBut director Joel Schumacher  , the completely wrong guy for the job  , puts style over content  , and while the direction and look are good  , it \'s   just not very disturbing .  ^\n\nSchumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience  , and though we are meant to be looking at the \' dark belly \' of the porn industry  , it does n\'t   exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind  , which misses the point .  ^\n\nAlso  , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed  , so cliched  , it \'s   amazing to think it \'s   the same film you \'re   watching .  ^\n\n8mm is far from an success  , a \' snuffed \' opportunity .  ^\n\nWith a boring lead character  , \' controversial \' scenes that manage not to be controversial  , and a director obsessed with looks  , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller .  ^\n\nUltimately  , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video  , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like .  ^\n\nAnd trust me  , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it .

cv306_10859.txt,'Here \'s   something to chew on  :  what \'s   the favorite food of big  ,  cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the  bowels of a luxury liner in DEEP RISING  ?   ^\n\nThe obvious answer to this  question is cardboard  , because that \'s   the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature .   ^\n\nDEEP  RISING demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something  scripted by a computer .   ^\n\nIn fact  , considering the rigid adherence to the  expected formulas  , perhaps it was .       ^\n\nThe most astonishing thing about DEEP RISING is the exceptionally  high level of gore .   ^\n\nNot since STARSHIP TROOPERS have this many chunks  of flesh ( both human and non-human  ) been scattered in all directions .    ^\n\nWe learn some bloody trivia  , as well  , such as how a sea monster  spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied  remains  ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers .   ^\n\nI suppose DEEP  RISING \'s   gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who  love the macabre  , but it does n\'t   do much for me .         ^\n\nOn the surface  , and that \'s   about the only level at which this film  can be analyzed  , DEEP RISING feels like TREMORS grafted onto TITANIC  ( everyone else is citing the equally valid ALIENS/TITANIC connection  ,  since James Cameron directed both  ) .   ^\n\nIn going for the big disaster angle  of TITANIC and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of TREMORS  , DEEP RISING  somehow misses both marks by a wide margin .   ^\n\nThe film is not humorous  ,  tense  , or exciting .   ^\n\nIn fact  , it \'s   downright boring  , and  , despite being  half the length of Cameron \'s   current box-office champ  , DEEP RISING feels  like the longer movie .       ^\n\nIs it really necessary to say anything about the plot  ?   ^\n\nProbably  not  , since it \'s   easy to guess  , but I \'ll   go ahead and oblige anyone who  wants a synopsis .   ^\n\nThe film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad  guys on board a mercenary ship .   ^\n\nIn addition to the usual cast of  psychopaths and lunatics  , there \'s   Finnegan ( Treat Williams  )  , the boat \'s    pilot  , who \'s   supposed to be an Indiana Jones knockoff  ; Joey ( Kevin J.  O\'Connor  )  , the inept sidekick who \'s   supposed to be lovable and funny  ( but is really just irritating  )  ; and Hanover ( Wes Studi  )  , the   \" mastermind  \" ( and I use that term lightly  ) of the operation .   ^\n\nTheir  goal  :  attack a cruise ship  , clean out the safe  , then sink it using some  illegally-acquired torpedoes .   ^\n\nThe problem is  , by the time they reach  the Argonautica  , the Titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the Marie  Celeste .   ^\n\nAside from a beautiful jewel thief ( Famke Janssen  ) and a  couple of crew members  , there \'s   no one on board .   ^\n\nThe reason soon  becomes obvious --   the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect  that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight  tentacles .       ^\n\nThe cast  , which is led by Treat Williams  , is primarily comprised of  has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions  : Wes Studi  , best  known as the villain in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS  , and Djimon Hounsou  ,  AMISTAD \'s   Cinque  ) .   ^\n\nWilliams  , once a  \" ca n\'t   miss  \" prospect in Hollywood  ,  has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a  lead role is a film like DEEP RISING  , and his inability to create a  charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his  sputtering career .   ^\n\nFamke Janssen  , who will forever be known as Xenia  Onatopp from GOLDENEYE  , is the perfect bland match for Williams .   ^\n\nGiven  her limited acting abilities  , it \'s   likely that she was chosen for this  part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes .   ^\n\nUnfortunately  ,  a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of  the picture .   ^\n\nMeanwhile  , Kevin J. O\'Connor  , who has entirely too much  screen time  , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a  blackboard .       ^\n\nThese days  , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with  computer-generated special effects .   ^\n\nThis is a lesson that  writer/director Stephen Sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action  JUNGLE BOOK  ) needs to learn .   ^\n\nThe days of JURASSIC PARK  , when viewers  were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and  imposing on screen  , are past .   ^\n\nNow  , movie-goers are looking for the  sophistication of TITANIC --   visuals that are so well-incorporated that  it \'s   impossible to tell where they end and where  \" reality  \" begins .   ^\n\nIn  DEEP RISING  , the monster  , like everything  , is artificial and  unconvincing .         ^\n\nUnfortunately  , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with  here is n\'t   so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture  , but  the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although  , to be fair  ,  DEEP RISING is a particularly bad entry  ) .   ^\n\nEven once this film has sunk  out of sight  , the knowledgeable viewer knows it wo n\'t   be the last of its  kind .   ^\n\nLike the slimy  , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and  pipes of these movies  , more are waiting just around the corner in  ambush .   ^\n\nAnd that consideration  , unlike anything on screen  , is truly  horrifying .

cv307_26382.txt,'DIRECTED BY: Martin Scorsese WRITTEN BY: Andrew W. Marlowe, vaguelly based    upon a novel by H.G. Wells CAST: Elisabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon, Josh Brolin,    Kim Dickens, Greg Grunberg     MPAA: Rated R for strong violence, language and some sexuality/nudity.   ^\n\nRuntime : USA:112      _________________________________________________________________     This is an adaptation of H. G. Wells \' acclaimed novel \'The Invisible Man\'  .   ^\n\nThe  actors  are Kevin Beacon and Elizabeth Shue .^\n\nThe director is Paul    Verhoven .^\n\nThat , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in    the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre .^\n\nThe problem is to    keep us there .^\n\nI ca n\'t  imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a    second time .    ^\n\nWorking on a top secret military project , Sebastian Caine ( Kevin Beacon ) --     an eccentric genius , that calls himself \" God \" , has discovered the secret to    invisibility .^\n\nThe first two faces are completed .^\n\nNow , it is time for \" the    next logical step \" --  human .^\n\nCaine volunteers for this risky experiment .^\n\nBut    when he is made invisible , something goes wrong .^\n\nWhile his ex-girlfriend    Linda ( Elisabeth Shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to    normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower .   ^\n\nBut that \'s  not the bad thing --  an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends    him careening into paranoid megalomania .^\n\nHe is naturally given a couple of    modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame    thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine .^\n\nSoon every    sense  of  decency is forgotten .^\n\nThe little intelligence that was left    disappears  as  Verhoven  looses  control  and  the film turns into an    Alien-rip-off , where Caine is walking like a half finished Terminator ,    spooking , scaring and killing everybody .    ^\n\nThough it \'s  based on a novel called \'The Invisible Man\' , the title has been    ironically changed to \'Hollow Man\' that sums up the film very nicely .^\n\nThis    is a very silly production .^\n\nLaughable , actually .^\n\nApparently Verhoven \'s     imagination does n\'t  stretch too far .^\n\nFor him the only worthwhile reason to    become invisible is so you can case the girls \' locker room undetected .^\n\nIt is    this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie .^\n\nBeing    invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want    without being influenced by society .^\n\nIn many ways it gives you an illusion    of having a life without consequences .^\n\nThe nature of man and his place in    society is what the novel is truly about .^\n\nAll that , the depth and true    horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your    seat .^\n\nCaine does use his power voyeuristically in Hollow Man .^\n\nBut since this    is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he does n\'t  stop there .   ^\n\nHe becomes a rapist .^\n\nAnd then , of course , a murderer .    ^\n\nYou \'ll  start wondering why such actors as Beacon and Shue found themselves    in such film in the first place .^\n\nShue \'s  talent is barely seen , Josh Brolin    is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent .   ^\n\nKevin Beacon is the only one that performs gracefully .^\n\nHis face is not seen    for  the  most  part  of  the film , and the only way he exists is as a    disembodied voice .^\n\nThere are times when his presence actually saves the film    from being completely embarrassing .    ^\n\nIn the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first    place .^\n\nBeing probably the best technical achievement since \" Jurassic Park \" ,    they are absolutely amazing .^\n\nWe observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue ,    and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible .^\n\nWe see a    beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood .   ^\n\nThere are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but    are  a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ?^\n\nWhat is truly    disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget ,    this could have been so much more .^\n\nPretty much like Jan De Bont ( \" Twister \" ,    \" Haunting \" ) , Paul Verhoven has never made anything extraordinary .^\n\nHe was    responsible  for  several  good  films ( \" Basic Instinct \" and \" Starship    Troopers ) \" and some incredibly bad films ( \" Showgirls \" , \" Total Recall \" ) , but    he  has never made anything that was great .^\n\nIn a way \" Hollow Man \" fits    perfectly in this collection .^\n\nIt \'s  not better or worse than Verhoven \'s     average film .^\n\nHe proves once again that he is incapable of handling more    complex issues .^\n\nAnd so , instead of depth and chills , Verhoven inserts some    of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot \'s  of dull action with blood and    naked bodies .^\n\nHe even throws in some of the worst of film clichs - the    slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc ,    etc. - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings    of the year ( you \'ll  be screaming \" NOOOOO ! \" and attempt to run towards the    exit in slow motion ) .^\n\nAnd all we can ask is why ?^\n\nThe answer is simple .   ^\n\nThough Hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking    has  to be about something more than money .^\n\nIt has to be about telling    stories ,  not  marketing them .^\n\nIt has to be about transporting us to a    different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness .^\n\nTo make us care , to    make us think and feel .^\n\nVerhoven has obviously missed that point and this    film is a proof of that .^\n\nIt \'s  all flesh and bones , but no soul.     a void where its imagination should be .

cv308_5079.txt,'Eddie Murphy has a lot riding on HARLEM NIGHTS .   ^\n\nAs the movie \'s   writer  , director  , executive producer  , and star  , Murphy will shoulder all of the blame if HARLEM NIGHTS fails .   ^\n\nBut at the same time  , he \'ll   receive all of the credit if it succeeds .   ^\n\nShould you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support Murphy \'s   risky gamble  ?

 !          ^\n\nThe movie \'s   problem is not Murphy \'s   direction  : HARLEM NIGHTS is a fairly good looking film .   ^\n\nNo  , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled .   ^\n\nMurphy \'s   awful script is the culprit .   ^\n\nLet \'s   count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting  :         ( 1  ) Murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture .   ^\n\nYes  , he even outdoes his own work in RAW .   ^\n\nPractically every line of dialogue in HARLEM NIGHTS contains at least one four letter word .   ^\n\nAnd after 15 minutes  , it gets irritating .          ^\n\n( 2  ) Murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast .   ^\n\nRichard Pryor  , Redd Foxx  , Michael Lerner  , and Della Reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes .  ^\n\nEach of them shines occasionally  , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle .          ^\n\n( 3  ) The movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men .   ^\n\nMurphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life  , which is really neither here nor there .   ^\n\nBut when Murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3,000 movie screens across the country  , it \'s   another matter altogether .  ^\n\nYou \'re   forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff .   ^\n\nFor instance  , Murphy punches Della Reese in the stomach .   ^\n\nAnd he shoots Jasmine Guy in the head .  ^\n\nThis is a mean-spirited movie  , folks  !   ^\n\nLovely newcomer Lela Rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore  , but only because she does n\'t   have any scenes with Murphy .   ^\n\nThank God  : he might have run her over with a bulldozer .          ^\n\n( 4  ) Murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date .   ^\n\nThe loveable Eddie Murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film .   ^\n\nMurphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality .   ^\n\nSometimes it seems as if Murphy made HARLEM NIGHTS just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair .          ^\n\n( 5  ) The plot is a shameless rip-off of THE STING .   ^\n\nIf you \'re   going to make another sting movie  , you \'ve   got to do something original .   ^\n\nMurphy \'s   tale of warring nightclub owners in Harlem ( circa 1938  ) fails to add anything new to the formula .          ^\n\n( 6  ) To get laughs  , Murphy makes fun of stuttering .   ^\n\nYou know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped .          ^\n\n( 7  ) Murphy \'s   idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life .   ^\n\nFor what  ?   ^\n\nFor shooting Reese \'s   little toe off  !          ^\n\nNeedless to say  , Murphy shows little  , if any  , promise or imagination as a screenwriter .          ^\n\nIn all fairness  , however  , a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie .   ^\n\nDanny Aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take .   ^\n\nAiello stands out in the large  , ensemble cast  : he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character ( a racist detective with mob ties  ) .   ^\n\nAiello \'s   zesty performance gives HARLEM NIGHTS some much needed spice .          ^\n\nAnother bright spot is Arsenio Hall  , who has a hilarious  , show-stopping cameo as a cry-baby gangster  ; Hall virtually steals the spotlight from Murphy .   ^\n\nIn fact  , Hall \'s   ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie .   ^\n\nUnfortunately  , his character is completely irrelevant to the plot  ; Murphy should have given Hall a much bigger role .          ^\n\nOf course  , I \'ve   already mentioned that I did n\'t   care for Murphy \'s   character  , but I have to admit that I did love his neckties .   ^\n\nThey are simply spectacular --  almost worth the price of admission  .'

cv313_19337.txt,'Let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire    official  (and  even  unofficial)  James Bond series.^\n\nIt is so full of    self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were    watching a spoof .    ^\n\nAn omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull    affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it \'s  difficult to give a    better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie )    and the assassin of the title .^\n\nA song with woefully terrible lyrics follows ,    and the rest of the movie is even worse .    ^\n\nThe plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so    often found in the James Bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused    mismash about a fabled assassin , Francisco Scaramanga ( Christopher Lee ,    putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this    movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to    remove Roger Moore \'s  007 .^\n\nThere is also a flimsy connection with the energy    crisis and a missing solar cell with 95 \% efficiency .^\n\nIt \'s  as much of a mess    as it sounds .    ^\n\nBond is \" helped \" in his task by Mary Goodnight ( Ekland ) , whose character    could n\'t  possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo .^\n\nDuring the    course  of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk ,    blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves    no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever .^\n\nMaud Adams ( later to star in    Octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly    features in the movie .^\n\nScaramanga \'s  lackey is a dwarf called Nik-Nak , who    rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series ,    serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures .    ^\n\nWorse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie .   ^\n\nThere is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a    ludicrous  scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained    martial artists --  another misguided attempt at humour ) .^\n\nThe solitary car    chase might have been a highlight , but the \" action \" is interrupted on a    frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( J.W.

cv314_16095.txt,'Since director Steven Zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay  for 1993 \'s   Steven Spielberg drama  \" Schindler \'s   List  \" and directed 1993 \'s    intelligent  \" Searching for Bobby Fischer  ,  \" his new film  ,  \" A Civil  Action  ,  \" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in  an otherwise prosperous career .  ^\n\nWhat does n\'t   make sense is how such  high-profile and superb actors as John Travolta  , Robert Duvall  , William  H. Macy  , and Kathleen Quinlan got involved in this project  , which is  both dull and completely ineffective .  ^\n\nThe film  , which involves a small  community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia  , certainly  contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged  , but somehow all  signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings  ,  leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama .  ^\n\nBased on a book by Jonathan Hart  , which was consequently based on a true  account  ,  \" A Civil Action  \" is set in 1982 in the town of Woburn  , Mass.  ,  where personal injury lawyer Jan Schlictmann ( John Travolta  ) decides to  take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their  children \'s   death from leukemia due to unknown causes .  ^\n\nJan originally  decides to drop the case  , but when he stumbles across to corporate  giants  , Grace and Beatrice Foods  , who have plants located near the  families  \' homes  , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place  : the  two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake  which  , thus  , goes into the city \'s   drinking water .  ^\n\nSuddenly  , after  hearing about the families  \' heartbreak and personal stories  , he begins  to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the  mystery  , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( William H.  Macy  ) that no money is coming in to them  , only going out .  ^\n\nAlso figuring  into the story is Jerome Facher ( Robert Duvall  )  , Beatrice Foods  \'  corporate counsel  , who finds himself in heated waters when Jan will not  accept his $ 20-million offer to settle the case .  ^\n\nComing from such a talented writer  , director  , and cast  , not to mention  one of the most interesting film composers  , Danny Elfman  ,  \" A Civil  Action  \" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama  , one that includes an  intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome  and occasionally even boring experience .  ^\n\nPerhaps one of its major  problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion  picture  , Zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude  with an absence of magnetism and even meaning .  ^\n\nWatching the film  , I could n\'t   help but notice its similarities with  1997 \'s   far  , far superior film  \" The Sweet Hereafter  ,  \" which dealt with a  lawyer  , played brilliantly by Ian Holm  , investigating a school bus  accident that killed a number of children .  ^\n\nIn his attempts to find  someone who may have been responsible for the accident  , Holm interviews  the grieving parents  , as well as the sole surviving passenger  , a teenage  girl  , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter  , a young  drug-addict who has run away from home .  ^\n\nNot only was the plotting  similar to  \" A Civil Action  ,  \" but it also had the same exact running time  of 115 minutes .  ^\n\nConsidering this  , it is amazing how fulfilling and  truthful  \" A Sweet Hereafter  \" was  , not only concentrating on the school  bus accident  , but delving deeply into Ian Holm \'s   character and his own  personal demons  , as well as the teenage girl .  ^\n\nIn  \" A Civil Action  ,  \"  however  , I have no idea where the running time went  , since the film is  virtually two hours of nothingness .  ^\n\nWe do not get to know the parents  very well  , nor any of the main characters .  ^\n\nThrough its whole duration  , I  did not learn one thing__not one thing__about Travolta \'s   lawyer  character  , Jan Schlictmann  , who does n\'t   appear to have any sort of life  or purpose outside of his job .  ^\n\nEvery scene is tediously related directly  to the premise  , and therefore  , there was no one for me to care about or  root for .  ^\n\nYou \'ve   got to work pretty hard  , actually  , to not get an  audience to become involved in the parents  \' plight  , since their children  are dead  , but that is exactly what  \" A Civil Action  \" does .  ^\n\nTo be honest  , I would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the  film that I actually liked .  ^\n\nAside from one flashback to when a man \'s    young son died on the way to the doctor  , I remained unmoved and passive  about what was going on in the scenes  , and more than once found my mind  wandering .  ^\n\nI could say the performances were good  , but who \'s   fooling  who  ?  ^\n\nSince every character is one-dimensionally written  , no one \'s   acting  abilities are challenged in any way .  ^\n\nTravolta plays a lawyer well  enough  , but that \'s   about all he does .  ^\n\nDuvall virtually sleepwalks  through his role  , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every  chance he gets .  ^\n\nAnd what in the world is Kathy Bates doing in the  picture \'s   final scene  , as a judge  ?  ^\n\nShe appears unbilled  , since it is  just a cameo  , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place  ?   ^\n\nFinally  , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role  ,  the film left me with another question  : what was the point  ?  ^\n\nAbruptly  ending without any susceptible momentum  , where none came before that to  begin with  ,  \" A Civil Action  \" seemed to me  , at least  , to be an example of  how not to make a courtroom drama  , and it certainly did not do justice  to the very serious subject matter the film deals with  .'

Michael Jai White ( Al Simmons  /    Spawn ) is second .^\n\nI ordinarily find Leguizamo an intensely annoying presence    in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the Violator .^\n\nThe    film , however , spends so much time on the Violator \'s  offensive antics that    they grate on the nerves .^\n\nApparently meant to be the comic relief in the    film ( as Nicholson was in BATMAN ) , especially when contrasted with the    sullen Spawn , the Violator \'s  lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny ,    leaving the audience wishing he would leave .^\n\nLeguizamo does a satisfactory    job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film .^\n\nMichael Jai    White , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing    actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without    various masks on .^\n\nMore time needed to be spent on White \'s  character before    he became Spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings .    ^\n\nA  special note should be made about Martin Sheen as the over-the-top ,    obnoxious , evil General Wynn .^\n\nEasily the hammiest performance in the movie ,    it \'s  hard to imagine how Sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he    played a Vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great APOCALYPSE NOW .^\n\nSheen \'s     excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind    villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film .    ^\n\nMany other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant    special effects to drag SPAWN down .^\n\nMTV-style , jerky , in-your-face editing    is one of them .^\n\nFlames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to    announce a shift in setting .^\n\nCogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for Spawn ,    serves as a poor narrator for the film .^\n\nHe goofily tells the audience , at    one point , that \" how much of [ Spawn \'s  ] humanity is left remains to be seen , \"    as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another .   ^\n\nThe music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and    offensive dialogue .^\n\nLoud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops    dominate some scenes .^\n\nTo be fair , however , Marilyn Manson \'s  \" Long Hard Road    Out of Hell \" effectively compliments Spawn \'s  return to Earth , while Filter    and the Crystal Method \'s  \" ( Ca n\'t  You ) Trip Like I Do \" proves a surprisingly    fitting theme song .    ^\n\nFor as good a comic book as it is , \" Spawn \" did not spawn a good movie .   ^\n\nSPAWN , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little    plot  and  character  development .^\n\nIt receivesstarsfor its technically    well-done special effects .^\n\nMany other films , though , have equal , if not    superior , special effects and are much better .^\n\nRated PG-13 , SPAWN seems more    violent than many R-rated movies and probably would n\'t  be appropriate for    the very young .

cv316_5972.txt,'I ca n\'t  recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time I was    having turned as sour as quickly as it did during FEELING MINNESOTA .^\n\nFor    forty minutes or so , I was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought    romantic comedy , and I was even giving Keanu Reeves the benefit of the    doubt .^\n\nThen , rather suddenly , I was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit    of  violence ; shortly thereafter , I was whacked in the gut by another .   ^\n\nFEELING MINNESOTA is a film that made me feel violated , as though I had    trusted writer-director Steven Baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water    and instead he threw acid in my face .    ^\n\nFEELING MINNESOTA tells the story of a topless dancer named Freddie ( Cameron    Diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss Red ( Delroy Lindo )    suspects her of stealing from him .^\n\nRed \'s  punishment is to force Freddie to    marry his bookkeeper , Sam Clayton ( Vincent D\'Onofrio ) , who is far from the    man of Freddie \'s  dreams .^\n\nEnter Jjaks ( Keanu Reeves ) , Sam \'s  estranged younger    brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch Freddie \'s  eye and    have sex with her in the bathroom .^\n\nUnited in their mutual attraction and    their mutual loathing of Sam , Jjaks and Freddie take off together , but Sam    is n\'t  ready to let them go without a fight .^\n\nFreddie , meanwhile , is n\'t  ready    to let Sam \'s  money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent    confrontations .    ^\n\nThere is both style and substance to the beginning of FEELING MINNESOTA , as    Baigelman opens with an effective montage showing Jjaks and Sam \'s  intense    sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( Tuesday Weld ) sending Jjaks away    to live with his father .^\n\nIt does a great job of setting up Jjaks \' unstable    life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always    trying to please his family ; Reeves \' wounded look is just right for Jjaks .   ^\n\nThe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the    aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very    funny spin .^\n\nMost important , Baigelman begins to establish the connection    between Freddie and Jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they    both spontaneously begin singing along to the Replacements \' \" I Will Dare \" on    the car radio .^\n\nYou would have every reason to expect that relationships --     both familial and romantic --  would be the focal point of FEELING MINNESOTA .   ^\n\nUnfortunately , you would be dead wrong .    ^\n\nI suppose I should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene    in which Red threatens Freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but I    certainly did n\'t  expect what I got .^\n\nWhat I got was yet another in a long    line of recent films trying to ride the Tarantino wave by mixing gags and    brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality .^\n\nSuddenly , the story of    romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse ,    and  everything  which  had come before degenerates so completely that    virtually nothing is recognizable .^\n\nThe sibling rivalry not only becomes    little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but    there is no consistency to the characterizations .^\n\nVincent D\'Onofrio turns in    a manic performance as Sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent    sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about Jjaks ,    while Reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of CHAIN REACTION , and    both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered    in blood .    ^\n\nThere  are  films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone    successfully ( Jonathan Demme \'s  SOMETHING WILD and Neil Jordan \'s  THE CRYING    GAME come to mind ) , but they did n\'t  try to draw an audience with the promise    of relatively innocuous entertainment .^\n\nI do n\'t  want to dismiss Baigelman \'s     successes out of hand --  he gets a fun performance out of Dan Aykroyd as a    crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments --  and it is not his fault    that Fine Line has chosen to promote FEELING MINNESOTA as a light-hearted    caper .^\n\nIt _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of    shock value , and that he ca n\'t  make his two halves into a whole .^\n\nFEELING    MINNESOTA left me feeling used , and there \'s  not much funny about that .

Jones \'    character ( Cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most    characters I \'ve  seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he    has .^\n\nAnd none of this can save the movie from being a D-grade level of film .   ^\n\nThe idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that    knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising    one .^\n\nA haunted house story in space is n\'t  such a bad idea .^\n\nBut the final    execution is extremely disappointing .    ^\n\nThat \'s  not to say that Philip Eisner ( here making his feature film-writing    debut ) does n\'t  have talent .^\n\nFor those firstminutes , he manages to make a    tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip-off    story , and that \'s  something that not too many writers can do .^\n\nHe even has    one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly    tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in    an  airlock while others try to save him from floating into space ) .^\n\nHe    definitely has something of a gift , but it \'s  not fully on display here .^\n\nI    certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and I hope that his    future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the    premise .^\n\nBut because of what this movie degenerates into , I have little or    no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it .^\n\nIf this is what we    have to look forward to in the future of film , then I agree with Laurence    Fishburne \'s  sentiment - \" God help us . \" '

cv333_9443.txt,'As a hot-shot defense attorney, Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) has a special    talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients.^\n\nHe is    also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to    sway  the  jury  while  breaking down a potentially damaging witness \'s     testimony . ^\n\nAnd , on top of that , he \'s  a damn good trial lawyer .^\n\nIn the    opening  scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is    guilty , but it does n\'t  hamper Lomax \'s  desire to creatively squeeze his    client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal .    ^\n\nHis unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of    the  most  prestigious firms in the country , headed by John Milton ( Al    Pacino ) .^\n\nHe is brought to their headquarters in NYC , where he immediately    impresses Milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head    of their newly-created criminal law division .^\n\nLomax is soon given the case    of his life .^\n\nHe must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a    triple homicide .^\n\nThe draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he    really is begins to isolate him in his own hell .^\n\nHe works late , defends the    guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but    fretful wife , Mary Ann ( Charlize Theron ) .    ^\n\nBut  what  starts  off  as  a  promising John Grisham-like story about    conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces    begin to tinker with the story .^\n\nIt begins like a typical parable where a    small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self    against the allure of money , power , and greed .^\n\nBut Milton is far more than    just a corrupt partner of the firm .^\n\nQuite literally , he is the Devil in    disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that    one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago .^\n\nFreaky and frightening    things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , Milton \'s     horrifying intent is finally revealed .    ^\n\nThe  movie  tries to give us two separate and distinct acts .^\n\nThe first    involves the comeuppance of Lomax as a big-city trial lawyer .^\n\nThe second    focuses  on  Milton  and  his  ulterior  motive  for  employing Lomax .   ^\n\nUnfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get    are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to    tie  them  together  and  an impressive production piece to give it an    underlying atmosphere .^\n\nGranted , the film is very handsome-looking .^\n\nYou \'ll     enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a    heated speech given by Pacino .^\n\nYou \'ll  also like the images of power and    temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties .^\n\nYou \'ll  also feel    the loneliness and insanity that sets in with Mary Ann , knowing that her    husband is slowly drifting away .^\n\nThis was one of the better storylines , but    unfortunately , is only a sub-plot .    ^\n\nAs with all thing \'s  involving the Devil , you can expect nothing but the    worst .^\n\nIn the first few scenes , Reeves anchors the film , but then slowly    drifts into the background .^\n\nHis path from self-vanity to self-consciousness    is never fully explored .^\n\nHis actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for    them not fully known .^\n\nPacino \'s  comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity    of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie .^\n\nThere is another    plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited .^\n\nThe focus seemed    inconsistent throughout , and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap .^\n\nThis    movie tries to be horrifying , thrilling , and dramatic all at the same time .   ^\n\nHowever , while The Devil \'s  Advocate strives to get noticed , ultimately it    makes very little impression at all .

cv334_0074.txt,'I\'m  not sure I should be writing a review of THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK,    because I\'m not sure just what the hell (pardon the expression) was going on    in it.^\n\nHowever , I can express the most important observation I made of it ,    i.e. I did n\'t  like it .^\n\nIf I had to summarize this film , I think I \'d  conclude    it was an updating of one of those old New England folk tales of someone    selling their souls to Old Scratch and how they try to get out of the deal .   ^\n\nThat \'s  the kernel of it , anyway .^\n\nTossed into this are little bits and pieces    that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism ,    the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship .^\n\nUnfortunately ,    little  or  no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these    concepts ; they \'re  simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes    on apace .    ^\n\nActually , I think that most of the audience was even more confused than I    was .^\n\nThey came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level    of GHOSTBUSTERS , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with    philosophical overtones .^\n\nThey laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that    were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could    bend the film away from it \'s  rather frightening direction .^\n\nThree women    ( Cher , Susan Sarandon , and Michelle Pfieffer ) live in Eastwick , a small    midwestern town .^\n\nOne night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin    wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives .^\n\nIn seeming answer to    their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill    and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be .^\n\nHe    soon shows evidence of mystical -- perhaps demonic -- power , and his devotion to    the women \'s  merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones .^\n\nEven worse ,    when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning    him .    ^\n\nAnyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting ,    and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially Sarandon \'s  character .^\n\nWe    never  get  inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their    dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland .^\n\nAs for Nicholson , well , even    The Devil needs a direction to go in , and while Darryl Van Horne is the most    interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter    and , more importantly , Nicholson \'s  acting ) , he still ca n\'t  be yanked in one    direction and then another without making him a little vague .^\n\nAnd then    there \'s  the special effects .^\n\nNot in themselves -- they were n\'t  that good -- but    their overuse .^\n\nI was almost positive , until I saw the credits , that THE    WITCHES OF EASTWICK was either produced by Alexander Salkind ( who has turned    out the slop named SUPERMAN II and III and SUPERGIRL ) , because of the big    name actors in dopy stunts , or Stephen Spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene    and the Nicholson-blown-down-the-street stunt .^\n\nNope , it \'s  another bunch of    guys ,  and  directed  by George Miller , who has shown great skill with    stunts/special effects before ( THE ROAD WARRIOR , \" Nightmare at 20,00 Feet \"    episode of TWILIGHT ZONE : THE MOVIE ) but apparently does n\'t  know when to    turn off the wind machine and let his people act .^\n\nF\'gawds sake , guys , this    is  JACK  NICHOLSON !^\n\nLet him loose !^\n\nLet him grin demonically !^\n\nSkip the    splitting earth and fake lightning !^\n\nWatching the scene where Nicholson is    tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all I could think of was , \" What a    waste \" .^\n\nIf you \'re  going to use slapstick like that , use it up on Pee Wee    Herman .    ^\n\nNicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings ,    can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of    the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he \'s  not sure what he should be doing    next .^\n\nAnd no wonder .^\n\nThis script goes all over the map , giving you the    feeling that it \'d  just love to be allegory , but it \'s  not sure about what --     maybe if you give it time it \'ll  think of something .    ^\n\nSo what is THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK ?^\n\nA horror movie ?^\n\nA folk tale ?^\n\nA comedy ?^\n\nA    statement about women ?^\n\nAn examination of the religious right or comparitive    morality ?^\n\nI tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for    me ... watching someone regurgitate half-digested bits of food and cherry pits    all over rooms , people , the screen , and ultimately , the audience .^\n\nIn other    words , a mess .^\n\nGrade : D ( $  ) if you like Nicholson enough to watch him here ;

cv335_16299.txt,'The most interesting thing about Virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes .   ^\n\nAlas  , it refers to our heroes  !   ^\n\nAs it turns out  , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the Mir space station  ) thinks of the human race as a virus --   perhaps even a cancer --   that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further .   ^\n\nAfter all  , we have taken up this entire planet  , and if they let us live for another billion years or so  , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one .  ^\n\nBut the human race does n\'t   have much to worry about .   ^\n\nAfter all  , there \'s   a woman named Foster ( Jamie Lee Curtis  ) out there stopping the computer virus .   ^\n\nShe \'s   the chief navigator on a sea vessel  ; travelling with her is Captain Everton ( Donald Sutherland  )  , Steve Baker ( William Baldwin  )  , Woods ( Marshall Bell  )  , Squeaky ( Julio Oscar Mechoso  )  , and Richie ( Sherman Augustus  ) .   ^\n\nThey \'re   all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous  , abandoned Russian satellite ship in international waters .   ^\n\nLucky for us  , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board .  ^\n\nThe evil Captain Everton thinks he \'s   going to take the ship in and get a reward  ; he convinces his crew that there \'s   going to be big money  , so they try to salvage the ship .   ^\n\nSoon  , however  , when it \'s   apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power  , they realize that something bad must have happened .   ^\n\nFinally  , they meet Nadia ( Joanna Pacula  ) who explains their situation  :  a computer virus has taken over the ship  !   ^\n\nIt \'s   creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race  !  ^\n\nVirus is a truly dumb action thriller  , one of negligible intelligence and innovation .   ^\n\nWhen considering the entire film  , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene .   ^\n\nIt \'s   a direct rip-off of nearly every James Cameron film ( Aliens  , The Abyss  , and the Terminator films are the most plagiarized  )  ; more importantly  , it \'s   basically the same movie as last year \'s   Deep Rising .   ^\n\nI liked Deep Rising simply because it \'s   funny --   it knows it \'s   silly and derivative .   ^\n\nVirus takes itself seriously .   ^\n\nAnd  , in the most serious manner possible  , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre  , showing you countless familiar scenes  , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming .  ^\n\nBut what is so amazing about Virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out .   ^\n\nOkay  , let me get this straight --   the alien race ( which is never really explained  ) is basically sentient electricity .   ^\n\nThey need to make themselves physical  , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water  , but who cares about that  ) .   ^\n\nOn the ship  , they make a bunch of clunky  , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people .   ^\n\nAfter that  , they start using the dead people to create half-human  , half-machine creatures that look like the Terminator but are much worse at walking around .    ^\n\nThe leader  , of course  , is a big creature .   ^\n\nEvery film like this has a big creature at the end  , but the big creature in Virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around .   ^\n\nVirus is indeed a cliched film  , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just is n\'t   very threatening .   ^\n\nIt \'s   established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it  , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there .    ^\n\nOn one level  , Virus is almost passable fun .   ^\n\nIt \'s   really gory  , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director  , John Bruno  , worked on a lot of Cameron \'s   films  ) .   ^\n\nThere \'s   also a nice array of actors  , even though none of them do any acting ( except for Donald Sutherland  , who does a lot of very bad acting  ) .   ^\n\nThe bottom line  , however  , is this  :  Virus is a bad movie .   ^\n\nIt rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing .   ^\n\nIn that order  , I recommend that you rent any one of the Alien films  , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes .

cv338_9183.txt,'WIZARDS is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions .   ^\n\nOver black and white drawings  , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange  , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation .   ^\n\nThe  \" original  \" inhabitants of the earth  , fairies and elves  , return to populate the globe  , along with their evil  , mutant counterparts .   ^\n\nOne day ( and I say  \" one day  \" not to be trite  , but because that \'s   exactly how it happened - no advance notice  )  , a fairy queen gives birth to twins  , one good and one evil .   ^\n\nThe twins grow up to be powerful wizards  , the good one embracing magic  , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire .   ^\n\nWe are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology .  ^\n\nAs unoriginal as the premise is  , I was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out .   ^\n\nThere \'s   a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world  , after all .   ^\n\nI soon learned  , however  , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film .   ^\n\nOnce the transition was made from still art to color animation  , an entirely different feel takes precedence .   ^\n\nRather than the epic saga promised by the narration  , we get a goofy-looking world of a Saturday morning cartoon .  ^\n\nNot just the look  , mind you  , but all the zany sounds like >honk< and >boing< when the characters go jumping around like  .... well  , like cartoon characters .   ^\n\nWhen we see Blackwolf  , the evil twin wizard  , he \'s   pretty much what we expect .   ^\n\nThe good wizard  , Avatar  , is nothing like he is depicted in the opening .   ^\n\nRather than a sagely master  , he \'s   more like George Burns  , complete with stogie in foot .   ^\n\nThat \'s   right  , he holds it between his toes .   ^\n\nHe does n\'t   even look the like he did in the black and white drawings .   ^\n\nHow disappointing .   ^\n\nPapa Smurf and Santa Claus are serious wisemen compared to this guy .   ^\n\nI imagine Yoda picks guys like Avatar out from between his teeth on weekends .  ^\n\nFor years  , Blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good  , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined .   ^\n\nHowever  , Blackwolf now has a secret weapon  :  Nazis .   ^\n\nYup  , Adolf Hitler  , the Luftwaffe and the Wehrmacht .   ^\n\nOkay  , not the real things  , but an archival film his minions dug up .   ^\n\nProjected into the sky for all to see  , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up .   ^\n\nBefore you know it  , there are dead elves everywhere .  ^\n\nThis is just as well .   ^\n\nThe characters are so bad that the viewer does n\'t   care about any of them .   ^\n\nThey \'re   either silly  , sappy  , or both .  ^\n\nThe dialog gets much of the credit for this .   ^\n\nAn example is when Avatar nonchalantly says  ,  \" Well  , looks like my brother and I begin our final battle .  \"   ^\n\nNot very formidable when he \'s   also the guy who says  ,  \" This is the biggest bummer of a trip I \'ve   ever been on .  \"   ^\n\nMy favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good ca n\'t   fight back against the Nazi-charged evil .   ^\n\nHer response is  ,  \" They have weapons and technology .   ^\n\nWe just have love .  \"   ^\n\nSuffice to say  , the characters are strictly two-dimensional  , and we therefore do n\'t   expect anything more than the obvious to happen .   ^\n\nWhich it does .  ^\n\nThe only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out  , which is anticlimactic and disappointing .  ^\n\nPlease note that it is the action that is unexpected .   ^\n\nThat it is disappointing is not .  ^\n\nThe film could n\'t   settle on a particular mood .   ^\n\nIt seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle .   ^\n\nScenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity .   ^\n\nThe dramatics  , which seem to occur at random  , are overly staged and overly acted  , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned .  ^\n\nRalph Bakshi  , the director  , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film  :  Hitler and the Nazis were bad .   ^\n\nSo who does n\'t   know this already  ?   ^\n\nWell  , maybe children .   ^\n\nOkay  , so you might say that this is a movie for children .   ^\n\nIt \'s   not .   ^\n\nIn the scenes where good fights evil  , there \'s   a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they \'re   watching a cartoon .   ^\n\nSo is the film for adults  ?   ^\n\nIf so  , we probably do n\'t   need to be bashed over the head to get the point .   ^\n\nWhy not have the bad guys be symbolic of the Nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know  ?  ^\n\nWIZARDS gives us a lot of footage of Nazi tanks and airplanes  , and Hitler giving speeches .   ^\n\nHowever  , we do n\'t   see any reason why they should be considered bad .   ^\n\nWe see no atrocities being committed  , not even any real battle footage .   ^\n\nThere is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the Third Reich  , and we \'re   not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place .   ^\n\nThis needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made  , since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment .   ^\n\nI \'d   like to assume that Bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the Nazis could happen anywhere  , at any time  , and we must therefore be vigilant .   ^\n\nHowever  , I \'m   not sure if I want to give him that much credit .

cv353_19197.txt,'\" The 44 Caliber Killer has struck again .  \"  ^\n\nLee is a great filmmaker  , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with Brian DePalma and Martin Scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to Steven Spielberg .  ^\n\nBut here  , he gets himself into a bind .  ^\n\nHis latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work .  ^\n\nThe summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in New York City .  ^\n\nIt was the hottest summer on record .  ^\n\nTo boot  , New York \'s   first serial killer was on the loose  : calling himself the Son of Sam  , David Berkowitz killed 9 people in the New York area and frightened the whole city population .  ^\n\nSo it was understandable that when NYC was hit with a citywide blackout  , people went berserk  , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city .  ^\n\nThe movie \'s   focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful summer  : Vinny ( John Leguizamo  )  , a club-hopping  , adultrous hairdresser  , his benevolent wife Dionna ( Mira Sorvino  , looking young  )  , Ritchie ( Adrian Brody  )  , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a Son of Sam suspect  , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters .  ^\n\nWe follow them through their roller coaster lives  , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings .  ^\n\nVinny and Dionna have marital problems because Vinny cheats and Dionna tries to please him  , make him stay faithful to her .  ^\n\nRitchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more  \" eccentric  ,  \" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend .  ^\n\nTensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of Son of Sam \'s   first murder looms  ; the night he promises he will strike again .  ^\n\nA local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects .  ^\n\nAt the top of the list is Ritchie .  ^\n\nVinny  , an unwilling part of the said group  , is called upon to set a trap for his friend .  ^\n\nAs we watch these proceedings  , some of which are painfully graphic  , the dreaded  \" So what  ?  \" question springs to mind .  ^\n\nFrom the way this movie is made  , I \'d   have guessed that Spike Lee was trying to tell us something  , but as I searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find .  ^\n\nLee touches on so much --   the media  , the 70 \'s   punk scene  , the details of the actual killings  , as well as the characters  \' very personal dilemmas --   but he does n\'t   bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement .  ^\n\nAll is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow  ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable .  ^\n\nToo bad Summer of Sam does n\'t   get any help here .  ^\n\nFrankly  , it \'s   a bore  , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that does n\'t   entertain beyond its first half hour .  ^\n\nThere is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague .  ^\n\nLeguizamo \'s   turn as Vinnie is annoying and whiny .  ^\n\nThe script makes it clear that we \'re   supposed to believe that his character is flawed  , but still a good guy .  ^\n\nYou \'d   never guess from his performance .  ^\n\nAdrian Brody and especially Mira Sorvino fare better .  ^\n\nSorvino gives a riveting  , touching performance in a banal movie ( I \'m   tempted to think that I liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane  )  ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart .  ^\n\nBrody  , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for .  ^\n\nSummer of Sam has some superficial elements of a good film  : it looks great  , it has a few notable performances and I suppose it \'s   pretty well directed  , in a purely technical way .  ^\n\nBut it \'s   also empty  , pretentious and boring .  ^\n\nLike last year \'s   The Thin Red Line  , it \'s   a movie by a director who does n\'t   know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway  .'

cv358_11557.txt,'WILD THINGS is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring  day provided  , of course  , that you \'re   the victim of a frontal lobotomy .    ^\n\nThere is  , in fact  , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at  :   movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties --   the most lucrative  target group .   ^\n\nThis is film noir for the MTV generation  :  fast-paced  ,  slick  , flashy  , gleefully mindless  , and hollow to the core .   ^\n\nWILD THINGS  is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during  the first eleven weeks of 1998 .   ^\n\nI \'ve   seen more convincing drama ( with  nearly as much bare flesh  ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality  ,  BAYWATCH .         ^\n\nWILD THINGS wants to dupe viewers into thinking it \'s   a thriller  with a real story .   ^\n\nWhat it is  , however  , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists .   ^\n\nEverything in  between those serpentine moments is filler --   a flash of a breast  , a  spatter of blood  , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a  Steven Seagal movie .   ^\n\nThe film tries so hard to surprise its audience  that the twists end up being easy to guess --   just take a stab at the  most unlikely thing to happen  , and that will probably be it .   ^\n\nUsing this  approach  , I was right three times and wrong only once .   ^\n\nThat \'s   not a  good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark  about what \'s   around the next corner .       ^\n\nThe ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie  :  the hot  , young  cast and the old standby  , sex .   ^\n\nBoth have an abundance of screen time  ,  although I \'ll   admit that the film \'s   erotic content is somewhat less  impressive than I expected .   ^\n\nNothing about WILD THINGS is exceptionally  risqu .   ^\n\nThe soft-core sex sequences are generic  , and do n\'t   generate  much heat .   ^\n\nThe lesbian kisses ca n\'t   hold a candle to those in BOUND .    ^\n\nTheresa Russell and Denise Richards have only token topless appearances  ( Neve Campbell  , possessing an iron-clad  \" no nudity  \" clause in her  contract  , keeps her clothes more or less on  ) .   ^\n\nThe film \'s   greatest  curiosity is a full frontal shot of Kevin Bacon climbing out of the  shower .   ^\n\nMaybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed Leonardo  DiCaprio for the thirteenth time in TITANIC to catch a glimpse of what  Kyra Sedgwick ( Mrs. Kevin Bacon  ) is familiar with .         ^\n\nThe director of WILD THINGS is John McNaughton  , whose last effort  was the finely-tuned psychological thriller  , NORMAL LIFE .   ^\n\nThat movie  featured copious sex  , a pair of real characters  , and a powerful script .    ^\n\nIt \'s   difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from  the same film maker .   ^\n\nBut I suppose we all need to put food on the  table .   ^\n\nMcNaughton appears to have completely lost his way here  , in what  is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release  picture  , MAD DOG AND GLORY  , was a box-office disappointment  ) .   ^\n\nQuick  cuts and pretty sunrises ca n\'t   even begin to cover up this movie \'s    flaws .       ^\n\nThe main character ( and I use that term lightly  , since no one in  WILD THINGS shows more than an occasional flash of personality  ) is Sam  Lombardo ( Matt Dillon  )  , a guidance counselor at Florida \'s   Blue Bay High  School .   ^\n\nA student  , the deliciously curvaceous Kelly Van Ryan ( Denise  Richards  )  , has a crush on him .   ^\n\nOne afternoon  , she comes to his house to  wash his car  , and  , when she leaves  , her clothing is torn .   ^\n\nAfter  confessing to her mother ( Theresa Russell  ) that she was raped  , she goes  to the police station  , where she tells her story to detectives Ray  Duquette ( Kevin Bacon  ) and Gloria Perez ( Daphne Rubin-Vega  ) .   ^\n\nThey are  skeptical about here claims until another girl  , Suzie Toller ( Neve  Campbell  )  , comes forward with a similar tale .   ^\n\nMeanwhile  , Sam  , convinced  that he \'s   being set up  , goes to a shyster lawyer ( Bill Murray  ) for help .       ^\n\nThe acting in WILD THINGS is n\'t   very good  , but none of the  principals have much to work with .  ^\n\nThis is definitely not a character- based motion picture .   ^\n\nNot only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the  possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit I.Q.  ,  but it does n\'t   bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a  hint of depth .   ^\n\nThe men and women populating the picture are there to  look nice  , but nothing more .   ^\n\nMatt Dillon is given plenty of  opportunities to flex

cv359_6751.txt,'Metro (Out of Four) R, 1997, 122m.^\n\nFilmed in Panavision .^\n\nDistributed by    Beuna Vista .    ^\n\nLike a good action film should , \" Metro \" has action that keeps you involved .   ^\n\nSome  action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our    attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts .^\n\n\" The Ghost in the    Darkness , \" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so    bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it    nearly put me asleep .^\n\nBut \" Metro \" is one of the best action films in a    while .^\n\nIt is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and    comedy .    ^\n\nEddie Murphy was in bad shape for a while .^\n\nAnd this invites me to mention    last year s \" The Nutty Professor , \" which was his blessed revival back to the    position at which he used to be .^\n\n\" Metro \" happens to be a lot better than any    film in the \" Beverly Hills Cop \" series .^\n\nThat is because \" Metro \" takes itself    seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun .^\n\nEddie Murphy    is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people .^\n\nThe    \" Beverly Hills Cop \" movies all featured Eddie as a reckless , wild cop ,    always crossing the line by just an inch .^\n\nIn \" Metro \" he plays a hostage    negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way    out of trouble .^\n\nHis character in \" Metro \" takes himself seriously .^\n\nEddie    Murphy  s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in    \" Metro , \" and perhaps it is quite better off that way .    ^\n\nMurphy  plays  Scott Roper , and as I previously mentioned , he is a San    Francisco hostage negotiator .^\n\nIn the first tense situation in the film , we    are introduced to Roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused ,    unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the San    Francisco bank he is holding up .^\n\nMurphy handles the scene seriously , without    his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor .    ^\n\nThe film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is    the beguiling Michael Korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let    cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim .    ^\n\n\" Metro \" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great ,    virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car .^\n\nCars flip .^\n\nCars crash .^\n\nCars    turn over .^\n\nAnd it is done so good in this film , I was reminded of \" Speed , \"    and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very    significant reasons .^\n\nThere are also some other good scenes in \" Metro \" that a    lot of films would rather choose not to have .^\n\nScenes like the one with Roper    and his new partner are at the horse track Roper is a gambler who knows all    the tricks and Roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and    winning . ^\n\nOf  course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being    insignificant by having Roper draw parallels between Hostage Negotiation and    gambling .^\n\nThe scenes between Roper and his girlfriend are nice , too .^\n\nThose    are the scenes that make up \" Metro , \" which is mainly about Eddie Murphy s    maturing as a personality .    ^\n\nThe actor that I most enjoyed seeing in \" Metro \" was Michael Rapaport , who    plays Roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master    of observation .^\n\nIt was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as    the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius .^\n\nRapaport is an    actor who I usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey    dimwit .^\n\nI hardly recognized him in \" Metro , \" and it was quite a joy to be    able to see him in a role like this I feel that I respect him more .    ^\n\nThere are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are    part of the story , and the ones that are devices .^\n\nThe villain in \" Metro \" is    no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless .^\n\nHe is    played by Michael Wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as    if he smokes a cigarette between every take .^\n\nWincott makes his villain ,    Korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an    old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like Richard Widmark in    \" Kiss  of  Death . \"^\n\nAnd , in addition , Wincott s physical appearance and    mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend I use to    have , who is no longer on my good list .    ^\n\nI liked \" Metro , \" and I do not think would have worked with any other actor    but Eddie Murphy .^\n\nHis past roles were the great ones but they were also a    precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from Murphy    s growing as a person , now having a family .^\n\n\" Metro \" is a no-nonsense movie .   ^\n\nIt works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay .^\n\nIt works as a dry    comedy , which it does not overplay .^\n\nIt works as a suspense film , which it    does not overplay .^\n\nAnd it works as an action film , where it does have a    tendency  to  occasionally go all-out .^\n\nBut who cares ?^\n\nIt still remains    serious ,  and  it does not overdo itself .^\n\nOh , and there were plenty of    explosions in \" Metro , \" as well .^\n\nHow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us    those .    ^\n\nIf there is one major objection I had to \" Metro \" , it was the length , an area    where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes .^\n\n\" Metro \" is a    film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it    gave me something to do while I waited for it to end .^\n\nPaul Haynes \" > '

cv364_14254.txt,'Dear God  , this is a fantastically bad film  !   ^\n\nRegardless of what I say about Knock Off  , you ca n\'t   grasp its awfulness from my words .   ^\n\nYou have to see it and experience it for yourself .   ^\n\nHere \'s   the kicker  , though --   I suggest that you do so .   ^\n\nYes  , this is a bad film --   easily one of the most incompetent films of the year --   but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure .   ^\n\nIn fact  , I enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time  , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story .    ^\n\nDo n\'t   get me wrong  :  I \'m   not excusing Knock Off .   ^\n\nIt reaches an unacceptable level of badness  ; it \'s   so incoherent that I wonder if it was hacked up worse than The Avengers was .   ^\n\nIt also features some truly terrible performances from Lela Rochon  , Michael Wong  , Paul Sorvino  , and --   of course --   Jean-Claude Van Damme .   ^\n\nIt does  , however  , have the entertaining presence of Rob Schneider  , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of Tsui Hark .   ^\n\nAs I watched it  , I occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness .   ^\n\nNow  , in retrospect  , it seems clear that it was n\'t    , but it \'s   still a fascinating kind of mess .  ^\n\nI do n\'t   like writing plot descriptions ( it is  , by far  , the most boring part of writing a review  )  , but  , in this case  , I \'m   off the hook  :  there is no way I could write an accurate synopsis for Knock Off .   ^\n\nFor the sake of comparison  , I had no trouble understanding The Usual Suspects during my first viewing .   ^\n\nI paid closer attention to Knock Off  , and the only thing I am able to say about it is that Van Damme plays a dude named Ray  , and is accused by the CIA ( I think  ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are  , of course  , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap  ) .  ^\n\nI do n\'t   know what any of this has to do with martial arts  , but there are lots of martial arts in the film .   ^\n\nRay is good at martial arts  , so when he has to beat up bad guys  , there \'s   no problem .   ^\n\nRob Schneider plays his sidekick  , although I had no idea who he really was by the end of the film .   ^\n\nLela Rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff  , while Paul Sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once  !   ^\n\nIn fact  , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do .   ^\n\nIn that order  , Knock Off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense .  ^\n\nBut what a strange mess it is .   ^\n\nIt was written by Stephen E. De Souza  , who also wrote Die Hard and 48 Hours .   ^\n\nCan this be the same man  ?   ^\n\nI do n\'t   see how  , unless  , of course  , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time .   ^\n\nKnock Off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go  )  , but there \'s   no semblance here .   ^\n\nFor instance  , Van Damme is introduced  , and then seconds later he \'s   running a chariot race through the streets of Hong Kong .   ^\n\nWhy  ?   ^\n\nWho knows .   ^\n\nWhat are the implications of this  ?   ^\n\nI have no idea .  ^\n\nMost action films abandon depth in favor of action  , and this is normally a problem .   ^\n\nKnock Off  , however  , is the first film that I would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut .   ^\n\nThe acting is embarrassingly bad  :  Rochon  , in particular  , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity .   ^\n\nSorvino  , in addition  , deserves better than this .   ^\n\nVan Damme is bad  , but he \'s   charming in that bad way  , and so I ca n\'t   say that he \'s   hard to watch ( although I rarely understood what he was saying  ) .   ^\n\nThe only exception is Rob Schneider  , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time .  ^\n\nTsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes John Woo look tame by comparison .   ^\n\nThey \'re   all pointless gimmicks though  , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe .   ^\n\nBut his action scenes are never boring  :  one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory  ?  ) is well-choreographed .   ^\n\nLots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy  , such as our heroes  \' first encounter with the Rochon character .   ^\n\nBut did Tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous  ?   ^\n\nI hope he did  , for the alternative is a frightening thought .  ^\n\nKnock Off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania .   ^\n\nIf it were boring  , I \'d   give it zero stars .   ^\n\nBut it \'s   not boring  :  it \'s   loud and excessive and completely incoherent .   ^\n\nIt \'s   also funny  , even when it is n\'t   meaning to be funny .   ^\n\nA bad film that succeeds as entertainment does n\'t   deserve to be fully lambasted .   ^\n\nI recognize Knock Off for its irrefutable badness  , but I ca n\'t   deny it \'s   zany  , useless charm .   ^\n\nOh  , I know  , they \'re   just action scenes looking desperately for a real story  , but they \'re   fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts .   ^\n\nIt \'s   fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this  , but that does n\'t   excuse the fact that it is  , indeed  , awful  .'

cv366_10709.txt,'Written by Michael Cooney Directed by Harvey Frost Starring Kelly LeBrock,    Wolf Larson, James Brolin Rated R (contains violence, profanity, and nudity)    100 minutes     Synopsis:  The president of a company wants to test his self-appointed    successor, who\'s psychotic, and thinks it\'s a great idea to spend a week    with  him  and  their  wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from    civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication    after a heavy snowfall.    ^\n\nComments : TRACKS OF A KILLER had a couple of strikes against it before I    even began watching it .^\n\nStrike one was the fact that someone had scrawled    the word GARBAGE on the videotape \'s  sticker in black marker ( not typically a    good sign when you rent a film ) .^\n\nStrike two came while the previews played .   ^\n\nDid you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie \'s  quality ( or lack    thereof ) while watching the trailers that come before it ?^\n\nWell , the cheesy    films being advertised before TRACKS OF A KILLER were films that no one has    ever  heard  of  starring people no one knows , and they all looked bad    ( definately  not a good sign ) .^\n\nTRACKS OF A KILLER itself completed the    strikeout .^\n\nAbout the only positive thing this film had going for it was the    fact that it sports some nice scenery .    ^\n\nTo  be  fair ,  the first half-hour or so promises at least a watchable    thriller .^\n\nWolf Larson , who bears more than a passing resemblance to Hugh    Grant , adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the    film \'s  title .^\n\nJames Brolin and Kelly LeBrock seem equally adequate as the    loving couple Larson will later threaten .^\n\nBrolin \'s  character , for some    inexplicable reason , thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin ,    practically isolated , with LeBrock and Larson , whom he \'s  decided to test for    the week before giving him full control of his company .^\n\nBy the time the    characters  arrive  at  the cabin , this film begins to become tedious .   ^\n\nApparently ,  Brolin \'s   successor \'s  test involves chopping wood for the    fireplace and skiing , which do n\'t  seem like attributes necessary to run a    business in the city .^\n\nBut , then again , what do I know about business ?^\n\nI do    think , though , that they should have invested in some better furniture for    the  cabin ;  its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the    slightest touch .    ^\n\nLarson \'s  character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he    wants to kill .^\n\nThis leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three    characters , which really is n\'t  enough to sustain it .^\n\nThe film \'s  writer must    have taken a cue from Stephen King , as scenes from TRACKS OF A KILLER seem    lifted out of MISERY and GERALD \'S  GAME .^\n\nLarson and LeBrock fight and torture    each other ( the tables get turned a couple of times ) while Brolin tramps    around in the snow looking for help .^\n\nSome old guy \'s  around too , just so the    killer can add to his body count without killing the couple , who everyone    knows  will  be  alive  at  the end of the film .^\n\nThe old guy , however ,    miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again    by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it \'s  worthy of a chuckle or two .   ^\n\nOutside of that chuckle , unfortunately , TRACKS OF A KILLER will just bore    you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors , for some    reason , become increasing obnoxious .^\n\nIf you \'re  in a video store and thinking    about renting this turkey , do n\'t  .^\n\nMake tracks to a far superior suspense    film , like MISERY .

 ^\n\nWhy did Tim Robbins  \' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside  ?   ^\n\nShould n\'t   the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach  ?  ^\n\nWhy are the characters such idiots  ?  ^\n\nBecause the script makes little attempt to properly develop them .  ^\n\nAll the  \" conflict  \" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off Orson Welles and Robert Altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot  ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know  :  \" Jim  , it \'s   too bad you ca n\'t   go on this mission because you were determined \' psychologically inadequate \' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together  \" --   does anyone really talk like this  ?  ^\n\nCa n\'t   we find out these things in a less grating matter  , like maybe in a flashback  ?  ^\n\nThe whole film is like that .  ^\n\nThe filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what \'s   going on  ; they must *tell* us exactly what we \'re   looking at *every* time .  ^\n\nSample dialogue from the film  : ( Shot of Mars  ) Astronaut A  :  \" Look  , there \'s   Mars  \" Astronaut B  :  \" You sure that \'s   Mars  ?  \"  ^\n\nAstronaut A  :  \" Yeah  , that \'s   Mars all right .  \"  ^\n\nAstronaut C  :  \" Hey  , are you guys looking at Mars  ?  \"  ^\n\nThat exchange is n\'t   actually in  \" Mission to Mars  ,  \" but I would n\'t   be surprised if it were .  ^\n\nFor all their cribbing from Kubrick  , Spielberg  , James Cameron  , and even Ron Howard  , the makers of this film have n\'t   learned to do something all those directors did very well  : show and do n\'t   tell .  ^\n\nDe Palma used to know how  , but seems to have forgotten .  ^\n\nThis is mentally-challenged filmmaking  ; they assume the audience wo n\'t   get what \'s   going on  , so they explain everything five times over .  ^\n\nFourth-graders may appreciate this  , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted .  ^\n\nThe principal actors sleepwalk their way through  \" Mission to Mars  ,  \" never managing to do away with an apparent  \" I \'m   just here to get a paycheck  \" attitude .  ^\n\nCheadle stumbles over his awkward lines .  ^\n\nArmin Mueller-Stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo .  ^\n\nRobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard  \" decent guy  \" performance .   ^\n\nAnd Sinise hams it up with  \" wistful  \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by Kim Delaney  , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life  )  , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them  ) conclusion  , which combines endless  , obvious explanation and sub-par CGI effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then .  ^\n\nAnd of course  , these aliens from Mars who facilitated the evolution of life on Earth are entirely different from the aliens in  \" 2001  \" who facilitated the evolution of life on Earth  ; those aliens were from an *unknown* world .  ^\n\nIt could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy  \" Mission to Mars  ,  \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going .  ^\n\nLeisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it  , but all of the substance of  \" Mission to Mars  \" has been stolen from other films  , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters .  ^\n\nSupposedly we \'re   intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of  \" Armageddon  \"  )  , but I suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning .  ^\n\nMe  , I alternated between the two .  ^\n\nThere is only one good thing about the way  \" Mission to Mars  \" finally ends  : the fact that the movie is over  .'
cv368_11090.txt,'One of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents .  ^\n\nYou keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered .  ^\n\nPsychologist Norman Goodman ( Dustin Hoffman  ) is called to the middle of the Pacific Ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash .  ^\n\nWhen he arrives at the site  , he discovers that there is no plane  , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1,000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years .  ^\n\nHaving written a paper for the Bush administration on how to handle first contact  , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the  ship .  ^\n\nHis group as outlined in his report  , consists of Beth Halperin ( Sharon Stone  )  , a biochemist  ; Harry Adams ( Samuel L. Jackson  )  , a mathematician  ; and Ted Fielding ( Liev Schreiber  )  , an astrophysicist .  ^\n\nUnfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for Goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team .  ^\n\n\" After all  ,  \" he explains  ,  \" who reads government documents  ?

 \" he asks .  ^\n\nBarnes is more pragmatic  : he needs a last name because he ca n\'t   put in his report that they made contact with an alien named Jerry .  ^\n\nThen the situation turns bad .  ^\n\nDeadly beasts appear from nowhere .  ^\n\nA gang of jellyfish kills one of the Navy personnel .  ^\n\nLethal sea snakes attack Goodman .  ^\n\nA giant squid batters the habitat just as Adams is reading  \" 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea  \" .  ^\n\nThe suspicious scientists turn against each other .  ^\n\nThis has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man \'s   science fiction film .  ^\n\nHowever even the finest ingredients do n\'t   go very far in the hands of a chief who does n\'t   seem to care about his product .  ^\n\nDirector Barry Levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that does n\'t   engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes .  ^\n\nThe first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification .  ^\n\nIt \'s   much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances .  ^\n\nIt does n\'t   get any better when the action scenes begin .  ^\n\nWhile the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles  , the people are still flat .  ^\n\nOddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them .  ^\n\nAfter Adams experiences the interior of the sphere  , no one bothers to ask him what happened .  ^\n\nTheir history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited .  ^\n\nEven Goodman and Halperin \'s   ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing .  ^\n\nHer psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing .  ^\n\nThere \'s   a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending  , but here they are far too obvious .  ^\n\nWhen an emergency mini-sub is explained  , you know what \'s   going to happen .  ^\n\nThe movie affectations are nothing more than distracting .  ^\n\nChapter headings that divide the movie have no function .  ^\n\nThe shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos .  ^\n\nMuch of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow .  ^\n\nAlthough some of the disorientation eventually is understandable  , a great deal of it is n\'t   .^\n\nEven a science fiction film must be internally consistent .  ^\n\nThere \'s   too much here that does n\'t   make sense .  ^\n\nAre the manifestations real  ?  ^\n\nThe jellyfish kill Queen Latifa ( in a throw-away role  ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost  , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect .  ^\n\nA scene in the sub suggests that it \'s   illusion  , but earlier episodes indicate that it \'s   not .  ^\n\nNot everything has to be explained to death  , but there are major questions that the film never answers .  ^\n\nWhere the ship came from is clarified  , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to .  ^\n\nEven the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll .  ^\n\nThe climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale .  ^\n\nAfter pre-release audience testing  , the actors were called back to re-shoot the ending .  ^\n\nIt \'s   difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse .  ^\n\nFollowing the recent tradition of lengthy films  , this weighs in at over two very long hours .  ^\n\nThe weak scenes could have been cut  , but then there would n\'t   have been much left .  ^\n\nThe movie was supposedly held up by effects work  , but there \'s   nothing special on the screen .  ^\n\nWe never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm .  ^\n\nStealing from  \" Alien  \"  ,  \" The Abyss  \" and the disastrous  \" Event Horizon  \"  , this film has learned nothing from them .  ^\n\nRemarkably Levinson and Hoffman \'s   other currently showing film is  \" Wag The Dog  \"  , a smart and entertaining piece of work .  ^\n\nThis one could have been titled the same sans one word .

cv369_14245.txt,'Renowned Hong Kong action director Tsui Hark first teamed with Jean-Claude Van Damme on the action star \'s   1997 pairing with Dennis Rodman  , _Double_Team_  , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick  , stylish  , and somewhat diverting action timekiller .   ^\n\nTsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the Muscles from Brussels  , _Knock_Off_  , but this time around  , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous  , and at worst incomprehensible  ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances .  ^\n\nWriter Steven E. DeSouza \'s   fairly straightforward plotline is n\'t   as outre as _Double_Team_\'s   strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison  , but it makes about as much sense  , which is little .   ^\n\nVan Damme plays Marcus Ray  , a Hong Kong-based sales rep for a jeans company (   !  ) who stumbles upon a Russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in HK product exports to the U.S. --  dolls  , electronic equipment  , and  , yes  , jeans .  ^\n\nIt \'s   all part of some type of ransom scheme  , but all I remember is --  and I kid you not --  graphics on a CIA computer screen showing a map of the world  , bombs detonating  , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter   ...  ... which is what the crowd at the showing I attended spontaneously did throughout _Knock_Off_ .   ^\n\nWhile all of Van Damme \'s   films have its share of unintentional laughs  , mostly due to the stiff acting  \" skills  \" of the physically agile Van Damme  , _Knock_Off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as Van Damme \'s   embarrassing directorial effort  , 1996 \'s   _The_Quest_  ) .   ^\n\nA lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by DeSouza  :  \" I smoked that badass like a Roman candle  !  \" and  \" Entrepreneurship  , babycakes  !  \" standing out among my favorites .   ^\n\nBut it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _Knock_Off_\'s   laughs .   ^\n\nVan Damme is true to laughable form  , perhaps even worse than usual .   ^\n\nEarly scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star Rob Schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover CIA agent posing as Marcus \'s   business partner  )  , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented Van Damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way .   ^\n\nEven typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug .   ^\n\nPaul Sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as Schneider \'s   CIA superior  ; and Lela Rochon  , playing an investigator for the jeans company  , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode .   ^\n\nIn Rochon \'s   defense  , though  , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs  , exquisite bone structure  , and perky bosoms  , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage .  ^\n\nTsui picks up where he left off visually in _Double_Team_  , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work .   ^\n\nHere  , though  , Tsui \'s   visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill  , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise .   ^\n\nFor each nifty trick Tsui pulls off  , such as a  recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices  , there are others that are completely superfluous .   ^\n\nThis is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context .   ^\n\nFor instance  , one scene early on has Marcus putting his hand in a box .   ^\n\nAs he puts his hand in  , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen .   ^\n\nIt \'s   undoubtedly an interesting visual  , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something .  ^\n\nThe test of a Van Damme movie boils down to the action sequences  , but surprisingly  , those in _Knock_Off_ leave much to be desired .   ^\n\nTsui does what he can to make something of them  , employing freeze frames  , blurred motion  , and unconventional camera angles  , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by DeSouza .   ^\n\nThere is n\'t   anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _Double_Team_  , let alone anything remotely close to Tsui \'s   legendary Hong Kong works ( but that \'s   a given going in  ) .  ^\n\nIf Tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman John Woo \'s   stateside success  , he would do best to break free from Van Damme   ... before it \'s   too late .   ^\n\nIf he continues his involvement with B-grade movies such as _Knock_Off_  , the respect he has from HK action fans will continue to diminish   ... that is  , if it has n\'t   already disappeared entirely after this fiasco .

cv371_8197.txt,'First Impressions: Critically, a close-to-awful film, but money-wise, it has    been doing (and will continue to do) great.^\n\nA sometimes-funny film that sags    and lags and oftentimes gets boring .^\n\nAn orginal plot that grows old real    fast .^\n\nOne of the onlyminute films that I \'ve  gotten bored through.      _________________________________________________________________     MEN IN BLACK has defied the odds .^\n\nWhen I first saw that the flick was 89    minutes  long ,  I  thought  maybe  that  this was a poor attempt at an    INDEPENDENCE DAY type film that just ran out of gas .^\n\nHowever , I now realize    that not only did MEN IN BLACK run out of gas , but the film in 90 minutes    manages  to show off a very original idea ( which summer audiences have    embraced ) that becomes old aboutminutes into the movie .    ^\n\nTommy  Lee  Jones  and Will Smith play two \" government \" agents who are    responsible for keeping order in alien society .^\n\nThe ridiculous plot begins    when an alien \" bug \" , played weirdly by Vincent D\'Onofrio , who was so great    in FULL METAL JACKET , lands on Earth to retrieve a galaxy that \'s  somewhere    on \" Orion \'s  belt . \"^\n\nAnyway , the basic plot revolves around Jones and Smith to    stop this bug from getting the galaxy , or a higher power will blow up the    earth .    ^\n\nThe premise is ridulous , but that is not why I did n\'t  like this film .^\n\nI love    original plots .^\n\nThis one had an original one .^\n\nBut director Barry Sonnenfeld    did something to this film that ruined its plot : He made the film drag and    also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films .   ^\n\nWhenever I saw D\'Onofrio \'s  bug stomp and eat people in the film , it got    terribly boring after a while .^\n\nWhile Smith \'s  wise-cracks did fill in the    gaps , it was n\'t  enough .^\n\nAnd also , I cannot believe the screenwriters elected    to have a sub-plot where Tommy Lee Jones missed his former lover because as    an alien agent , they ca n\'t  have contact with any humans really .^\n\nAnd here I    see Jones , at a satellite computer , watching his lover plant the garden ?^\n\nA    sentimental moment in an alien movie ?^\n\nNice try , but I do n\'t  think so .^\n\nIt    does n\'t  work here .^\n\nIt just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even    more boring : We do n\'t  only have aliens to worry about , but now we have    Jones \'s  conscience .    ^\n\nI came into the movie not wanting to see Jones \'s  conscience , but wanting to    see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it .^\n\nMaybe it \'s  unfair    that I partly judged this movie on what my expectations were .^\n\nNevertheless ,    even though some parts are indeed funny , the plot in this movie grew old and    boring --  quick .

familiar evil voice .    ^\n\nThe late Randy Meeks ( Jamie Kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via    video to explain the rules of a trilogy .^\n\nHe notes the third chapter in a    trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend    with .^\n\nIndeed , \" Scream 3 \" tries to link its murders back to the one that    started it all , the murder of Sidney \'s  mother Maureen before the beginning    of the original \" Scream . \"^\n\nAt the scene of each murder in \" Scream 3 , \" the    killer leaves a photo of Sidney \'s  mother Maureen as a teenager in Hollywood    and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer .^\n\nTo find out who the    killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during    Maureen \'s  missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget    horror films .^\n\n( Even with that little information , you can probably already    guess what the killer \'s  relationship to Sidney is ) .    ^\n\nUnlike its predecessors , \" Scream 3 \" does n\'t  have the guts to even suggest    that  the central characters might be the killer .^\n\nThe characters we do    suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we do n\'t  even care who the    killer is .^\n\nThe jaded detective ( Patrick Dempsey ) ?^\n\nThe kinky producer ( Lance    Henriksen ) ?^\n\nThe driven young director ( Scott Foley ) ?^\n\nThe ingenue ( Emily    Mortimer ) ?^\n\nThe character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected    at random .^\n\nWes Craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the    real one a secret , so it \'s  quite possible the one in the final cut was    randomly chosen .    ^\n\nThe series \' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and    obvious .^\n\nPossibly it \'s  the absence of screenwriter Kevin Williamson , who    penned the first two , or maybe it \'s  that the hip ironic stance eventually    consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a    cliche . ^\n\nI  groaned as an attack on Sidney from the first \" Scream \" was    repeated moment-for-moment in the Hollywood set of her home .^\n\nAt some point ,    referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas .    ^\n\n\" Scream 3 \" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos    and familiar faces in small roles .^\n\nLook for Jenny McCarthy , Carrie Fisher ,    Patrick Warburton ( Puddy from \" Seinfeld \" ) , Roger Corman , and Jason Mewes and    Kevin Smith ( as Jay and Silent Bob ) to walk through at some point .^\n\nAll these    bit players put forth more effort than the series \' returning stars , who are    probably saving their energy for the long post-\"Scream \" job search .    ^\n\nAnother prediction I made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies    are copying \" The Blair Witch Project\"\'s  web strategy .^\n\n\" Scream 3 \" has three    official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are    real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie .   ^\n\nThe  Sunrise Studios site ( scream3.com ) has trailers for other Sunrise    releases as well as the \" latest \'Stab 3\' news . \"^\n\nThere \'s  also a Gail Weathers    official site ( galeweathers.com ) and a Sunrise Sucks site that has more    \" Stab \" scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks.com ) .    ^\n\nCraven and company promise that this is the last installment in the \" Scream \"    series .^\n\nWhile I hope that \'s  true , I do n\'t  hold out much hope-horror movie    series are even harder to kill than their monsters .^\n\nThere \'s  a \" Halloween    H2K \" in the works , even though Michael Myers was beheaded in \" H20 , \" and a    \" Freddy vs. Jason \" has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that    both characters were \" killed off . \"^\n\nThere \'s  bound to be a \" Scream 4 \" someday ,    even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes .    ^\n\nBottom Line : They should have called this one \" Yawn . \"    ^\n'

Robbins , serves as a cheaply-made precursor to STRANGE DAYS , a far superior    film .^\n\nBoth movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their    current lovers because they are ( ab)using technology to be with former    lovers ( in STRANGE DAYS , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than    virtual reality ) .^\n\nInterestingly , both films also take place a couple of    years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though STRANGE DAYS    uses the setting far more effectively .^\n\nThis exemplifies the problem with    VIRTUAL SEDUCTION .^\n\nIt \'s  not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction    concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality .^\n\nUnfortunately , it \'s     been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately    leaves the sci-fi fan bored by this movie .    ^\n\nVIRTUAL SEDUCTION has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video    inexplicably  has its own trailer before it begins ) .^\n\nThe film \'s  script    explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but    its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy-handed and wooden as the    movie progresses .^\n\nMany important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could    have been improved significantly .^\n\nThe cast , a collection of veteran B-movie    actors and sitcom regulars , do only a mediocre job in their roles .^\n\nJeff    Fahey , of the original LAWNMOWER MAN , convincingly , though unenergetically ,    plays the lead character .^\n\nCarrie Genzel plays Paris , the VR lover , but Ami    Dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and    attractive character with a caring personality , which does n\'t  lend credence    to the film \'s  premise .^\n\nMeschach Taylor , of the once popular DESIGNING WOMEN    sitcom ,  adequately  plays a scientist working on the project , but his    performance is n\'t  something to write home about either .    ^\n\nVIRTUAL SEDUCTION is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some    light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background .^\n\nIn other    words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then ,    but it \'s  rather boring to just sit and watch .^\n\nThe movie is surprisingly not    as violent as one expects from B-movies in this genre , but it is still an    adult R-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt .^\n\nThis    turkey , ultimately , is n\'t  awful , but it \'s  not particularly interesting or    unique either .^\n\nDo n\'t  be seduced into watching this movie unless you \'ve  got    several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch .

 ^\n\nThe film introduces us two three different characters who  , in the beginning  , are considered outsiders because they \'re   not ( yet  ) part of this clique  : the new kid  , Steve ( James Marsden - dull dull dull dull  )  , who \'s   having trouble at home because he has n\'t   gotten over his brother \'s   ( Ethan Embry  , in quick flashes so you do n\'t   recognize him - I did  ) suicide  ; the renegade girl  , Rachel ( Katie Holmes  , from  \" Dawson \'s   Creek  \"  )  , who \'s   chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring  ; and by far the most interesting kid  , Gavin ( Nick Stahl  , the kid from  \" The Man Without a Face  \"  )  , who \'s   the most interesting because he \'s   the only character who \'s   given some dimension .   ^\n\nIn the film \'s   best scene  , he introduces Steve to every single clique  , nailing each one \'s   fetishes and hang-ups  , and it \'s   the best scene in the movie because it \'s   witty  , satirical  , and interesting - something the rest of this film is n\'t   .^\n\nGavin suspects there \'s   something awry with the preppie kids  , known as The Blue Ribbons  , and in the tradition of all conspirators  , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to Steve  , he \'s   only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff .   ^\n\nHere  , we have another case of  \" The Idiot Plot  ,  \" where not only could Steve had done something about Gavin and what happens to him  , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary  , dull film that it is without Gavin  , who gives it life and humor .   ^\n\nThe only other half-interesting character is the school janitor  , played by William Sadler as a retarded  , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be  ... but really  , we do n\'t   care anyway .  ^\n\nI probably should n\'t   mention that this was directed by David Nutter  , who \'s   works for  \" The X-Files  ,  \" because that would probably tarnish his reputation .   ^\n\nLike the show  , he \'s   good at setting up weird conspiracies  , and creating a general creepy feel .   ^\n\nMost of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect  , and some of it works .   ^\n\nBut what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff .   ^\n\nHe keeps too much inside  , so much that when the characters journey to a Mental Institution in the Third Act  , you wonder why they just do n\'t   get the hell out of there .   ^\n\nI think what happens to Gavin is proof enough that there \'s   something rotten in the state of teen angstdom .  ^\n\nWhat this film needs to be is a lot longer  , a lot more colorful  , and a lot creepier .   ^\n\nIf the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor ( played by Bruce Greenwood  , an Atom Egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent  ) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed  , then they need to come up with a tougher  , smarter villain .   ^\n\nIf he \'s   so villainous  , then why could two dense teenagers who could n\'t   figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes  ?   ^\n\nThe film  , which runs about 80 or so minutes  , just needs to work on these things  , and become a lot less sloppy .   ^\n\nAt such a short running time and with such lame  , boring characters as these  , it \'s   pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one \'s   mouth  , especially mine .

cv402_16097.txt,'In the interest of being generous, I want to start this review with the    scene  that  I liked in Meet Joe Black.^\n\nSir Anthony Hopkins , playing a    super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner .^\n\nHis    oldest daughter ( played by Marcia Gay Harden from Millers Crossing ) , who has    been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents    him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be    scale models for his big birthday cake .    ^\n\nThe daughter asks Hopkins to pick the one he likes .^\n\nHopkins , frustrated by    the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in    his position would do : he punts .^\n\nWhichever one you like , dear , he says .^\n\nAnd    the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she    cries .    ^\n\nI liked that scene for two reasons .^\n\nFirst , the cakes looked really cool .   ^\n\nSecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as    you  would  expect  people to act .^\n\nMeet Joe Black is chock-full of odd    performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and    doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot .^\n\nIt \'s  easy    to watch Meet Joe Black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and    the beauteous Claire Forlani , but it \'s  even easier to sleep right through it    ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) .^\n\nThe difficult part of the    movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone    thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess .    ^\n\nI know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was    a comedy .^\n\nCase in point : Everyone should know by now that Brad Pitt plays    the Angel of Death in this movie .^\n\nHowever , the first we see of him is as a    young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous Claire Forlani .^\n\n( It \'s     not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the Angel    of Death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . )^\n\nIt should n\'t  take long for    the observant moviegoer to realize that Bad Things are about to happen to    Mr. Pitt .^\n\nAnd indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where    Pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating Forlani and Forlani looks    over her shoulder at the retreating Pitt ) , because Pitt walks into the road    without looking and suddenly gets squished .^\n\nWell , when that happened , the    audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that    was  remotely humorous .^\n\nSo , if you think that sudden violent death and    sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , I encourage you to go see Meet Joe    Black immediately .    ^\n\nAnyway , the deceased lawyer \'s  body , no worse the wear from its massive    injuries , is possessed by the Angel of Death and Brad Pitt takes over that    role .^\n\nThe idea is that Death ( given the pen name of Joe Black , so as not to    disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world .^\n\nIf this    were n\'t  Hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of    life  and  death ,  but  since  it  is ,  we  get  scene  after scene of    fish-out-of-water  humor ,  just as if Death is George of the Jungle or    Crocodile Dundee or some other poor schmuck who \'s  wandered in from the    jungle  or  the outback or whatever and does n\'t  know how to act in our    society .    ^\n\nIt  also  does n\'t   help  that  the  character  of  Death is written so    inconsistently .^\n\nHe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything    except hang around the seriously attractive Claire Forlani ( just try to get    your travel agent to book that one ) .^\n\nHe speaks very slow and halting English    but  perfectly  fluent Jamaican patois .^\n\nHe knows everything about some    characters , nothing about others .^\n\nAnd as played by Brad Pitt , he \'s  not    especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he \'s  just there .   ^\n\nIt \'s  as if someone told Pitt , \" Never mind about acting in this picture , son ,    just stand there and look pretty . \"^\n\nIt \'s  as if Pitt is doing his Keanu Reeves    impression throughout the movie .    ^\n\nI \'ve  used the phrase \" Angel of Death \" in this review very deliberately to    contrast Pitt \'s  performance with this year \'s  best angel performance , Nicolas    Cage \'s  in City of Angels .^\n\nWhere Pitt is cold and unfeeling , Cage is as warm    and empathetic as the situation allows .^\n\nWhere Cage is genuinely curious    about the nature of man , Pitt is aloof and arrogant .^\n\nCage struck instant    chemical sparks with co-star Meg Ryan , where the chemistry between Pitt and    Forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that Forlani \'s     character is so shallow that she ca n\'t  see beyond Pitt \'s  good looks .    ^\n\nThe movie \'s  other top name is a much better actor , but that does n\'t  save    Meet Joe Black .^\n\nSir Anthony Hopkins is n\'t  given much better material to work    with , unfortunately .^\n\nHe plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire    media moguls that only exist in Hollywood .^\n\n( One wonders what might have    happened if they had made Hopkins \'s  character more realistically evil . )   ^\n\nHopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but Death steps in and    grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world .    ^\n\nOf course , no one can be sure of how they will act when Death taps on their    shoulder .^\n\nBut I have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time    to wonder ) how you or I would act in a similar situation , especially if you    or I were a multimillionaire .^\n\nHopkins pretty much goes to the office --  and    the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation .^\n\nFans of    corporate intrigue will be fascinated , I \'m  sure .    ^\n\nI stayed awake all the way through Meet Joe Black , and I \'m  asking myself    why .^\n\nMovies about Death should encourage you to live life to the fullest ,    which  is what I \'m  going to do now .^\n\nGo spend time with your family , go    volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap .^\n\nDo n\'t  go see Meet Joe    Black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .

) and doing a few interesting    things with it .^\n\nAs vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling by    a runaway cable car , it is possible at least for a moment to take some    pleasure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation .^\n\nCarter does an even better    job by taking that old suspense stand-by --  the medicine cabinet mirror    which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone --  and using it    to defuse tension not once , but _twice_ .^\n\nThe fact that Carter was able to    demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches , and a willingness to    subvert them , makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is    METRO all the more puzzling .^\n\nAn action film like this plods so relentlessly    and  obviously  from point A to point B to point C that you might find    yourself shouting out \" point C ! \" while they \'re  still getting to point B , or    getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which    signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen . \n'

cv415_23674.txt,'It \'s   been hours since I returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus ` Mission to Mars  \'  , and I can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar .  ^\n\nWhy  ?  ^\n\nThe movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy  , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera  , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to ` 2001  : A Space Odyssey \' .  ^\n\nI got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another ` Armageddon \' .  ^\n\nBut no  , ` Mission to Mars  \' certainly is n\'t   one large action sequence about colossal disaster .  ^\n\nThis is a supposedly thoughtful  , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel .  ^\n\nYou have been warned .  ^\n\nOf course  , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see ` Apollo 13 \' for an excellent example  )  , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation .  ^\n\nBrian De Palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off .  ^\n\nWhen he gets his hands on an intelligent  , systematically practical script like ` The Untouchables  \' or ` Mission  : Impossible \'  , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally  ) .  ^\n\nOf course  , there \'s   also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including ` Snake Eyes  \' and the notorious bomb ` The Bonfire of the Vanities  \'  )  .... all of which makes me want to call De Palma the most talented hack in Hollywood .  ^\n\nThat term may be too harsh  , but if I were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is ` Mission to Mars  \'  , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient .  ^\n\nIf I were Gary Sinise  , I would n\'t   touch De Palma with a 10-foot pole .  ^\n\nSinise is a wonderful  , wonderful actor  , but after appearing in ` Snake Eyes  \' and this vomit-inducing sham  , I \'m   sure he would n\'t   want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration .  ^\n\nThe Academy Award-winner plays NASA astronaut Jim McConnell  , a man who recently lost his wife ( Kim Delaney  ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to Mars ( oops  , forgot to mention the year - 2020  ) .  ^\n\nAfter a barbecue get-together for the astronauts  , we cut to Luc Goddard ( Don Cheadle  ) and his team  , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the Red Planet .  ^\n\nSuddenly  , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a ` sand tornado \' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction .  ^\n\nFor some reason  , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this  , as if it were a lovely piece of art .  ^\n\nThe team is killed within seconds  , expect for Luc  , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive .  ^\n\nImmediately  , a second mission - consisting of astronauts McConnell  , husband and wife Woody and Terri Blake ( Tim Robbins and Connie Nielsen  ) and Phil Ohlmyer ( Jerry O\'Connell  ) - are dispatched to rescue Luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet Mars .  ^\n\nLet \'s   put the ` secret \' on hold for now  , and discuss the trip there .  ^\n\nIt is explained  , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not  )  , that a trip to Mars takes roughly six months .  ^\n\nI \'m   not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind ` M2M \' did n\'t   capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia .  ^\n\nInstead  , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship .  ^\n\nWhat happened during the five months prior to this  ?  ^\n\nDid they just play cards and tell dirty jokes  ?  ^\n\nStill  , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie  ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak .  ^\n\nDePalma \'s    direction is quite good in these scenes  , although the score by Ennio Morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space  ?  ^\n\nC\'mon  ) .  ^\n\nThere \'s   a few good  , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese  , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud .  ^\n\nIt \'s   a colossal bummer that ` Mission to Mars  \' is poorly assembled and laughably written  , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists .  ^\n\nAs mentioned before  , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed   ... maybe even cheated .  ^\n\nAfter the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words The End \' somehow adding insult to injury  )  , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen .  ^\n\nOthers muttered obscenities  , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling ` Jeez  , that sucked . \'  ^\n\nOkay  , it did suck .  ^\n\nBut you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy   ... after all  , they do pretty well .  ^\n\nSinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes  , Robbins and Nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving NASA couple  , and funnyman O\'Connell - well  , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so  ) .  ^\n\nThe digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive .  ^\n\nSo  , by golly  , where did this ` Mission \' go wrong  ?  ^\n\nLooking back on the appalling experience  , I would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have .  ^\n\nWhile watching ` Mission to Mars  \'  , my suggestion would be to immediately abort  , or better yet  , do n\'t   even strap yourself in for lift-off  .'

Confidential  \"  )  , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly  unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea ---  a movie with non-stop  violence  , death  , and villains ---  and runs with it  , or should I say  ,  barely manages to crawl away with it .  ^\n\nMel Gibson  , in yet another disappointing picture (  \" Conspiracy Theory  \"  and  \" Lethal Weapon 4  ,  \" anyone  ?  )  , stars as the reprehensible  villain/hero  , Porter  , a man who becomes determined to get his 50  \% share  of $ 140,000  , which he stole in a robbery  , back when his partner-in-crime  ( Gregg Henry  ) and drug-addicted wife ( Deborah Kara Unger  ) double-cross  him  , shoot him  , and leave him for dead .  ^\n\nPorter is not dead  ,  however ---  not by a long shot ---  as he quickly rehabilitates and  , along  with his loyal prositute girlfriend  , Rosie ( Maria Bello  )  , sets out to  make everyone involved in the scam pay .  ^\n\nThe tagline for  \" Payback  \" is  ,  \" get ready to root for the bad guy  ,  \" and  sure enough  , this is true  , as pretty much every significant character  who appears is crooked in some way .  ^\n\nI would n\'t   have a problem with this  offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest  , but  it was n\'t    , and therefore  , I found myself having an especially laborious  time investing myself into a wide array of character that have  absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever .  ^\n\nNo attempt is made to  flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters  , and there are no  vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them .  ^\n\nJust because  the protagonist  , a  \" bad guy  ,  \" is played by Mel Gibson does n\'t   mean I  will  \" root for him  ,  \" and I did n\'t   .^\n\nQuite the contrary  , every person in  the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did  ,  anyway  , just to spice up the dull proceedings  ) .  ^\n\nSince none of the respectable actors in  \" Payback  \" actually have human  beings to play  , only one performance managed to stand out .  ^\n\nLucy Alexis  Liu ( of T.V.\'s    \" Ally McBeal  \"  )  , who plays a spicy S&M dominatrix  ,  brightens up every scene she is in  , and has a definite flair for comedy  ,  something I would have liked to have seen more of  , since most of the  humor fell with a resounding splat .  ^\n\nMeanwhile  , Gibson  , who is perfectly  fine here  , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit  challenging .  ^\n\nUnger  , who made an impression in 1997 \'s    \" The Game  ,  \" is  surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part  since she disappears ten minutes in  , and only has two purproses  : ( 1  ) to  get high on heroin  , and ( 2  ) because she plays a key part in an early  flashback .  ^\n\nFinally  , Kris Kristofferson appears in a throwaway role  during the climax  , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like  a sore thumb ( tellingly  , he did n\'t   appear in the original cut of the  film  , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later  ) .  ^\n\nLike most action movies  , the star often takes a licking but keeps on  ticking .  ^\n\nIn the course of the 102-minute running time of  \" Payback  ,  \"  Porter is shot three times in the back  , hit by a van  , beaten up  , and has  his feet smashed with a sledgehammer .  ^\n\nAnd guess what  ?  ^\n\nNot only does he  survive the whole ordeal  , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate  sequence ( and can still walk  !  )  , even though he looks like he had  recently substituted for a punching bag .   ^\n\n\" Payback  \" is not  , in any way  , an entertaining film  , even though I am  sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes  on  , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is  a blank screen .  ^\n\nPerhaps director Helgeland would have been smart to  consider this  , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile  elements  , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even  remotely stand to be around for a few hours  .'

 ^\n\nJB  :  My opinion  :  the producers should have stopped while they were  ahead  , and that was nine years ago .   ^\n\nOne entry was definitely enough  ,  and I \'m   surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low  quality of MAJOR LEAGUE 2 .   ^\n\nThis latest installment has all the earmarks  of something that should have been released direct-to-video .   ^\n\nIt \'s   worse  than a mediocre made-for-TV feature .   ^\n\nI should also mention that this  movie likely wo n\'t   play all that well in Cleveland .   ^\n\nNow that the real  Indians are perennial contenders  , they have been replaced by the  Minnesota Twins as the cinematic sadsacks .   ^\n\nActually  , most of the action  involves the Twins  \' AAA minor league club  , the Buzz  , rather than the  actual major league franchise .  ^\n\nHC  :  Sorry to interrupt  , Jim  , but we still have to do play-by-play for  the game on the field .   ^\n\nLeading off this inning is John Warren .   ^\n\nHe  steps into the batter \'s   box and takes Kent \'s   pitch low for ball one .  ^\n\nWH  :  So  , the story \'s   strictly minor league  , right  ?   ^\n\nWhat \'s   it about  ?  ^\n\nJB  :  Scott Bakula  , the guy from QUANTUM LEAP  , plays career minor league  pitcher Gus Cantrell .   ^\n\nWhen Twins owner Roger Dorn  , once again portrayed  by Corbin Bernsen  , needs a new manager for his AAA team  , he offers the  job to Gus  , who is now faced with two daunting tasks  :  turn the team  around and groom hot prospect Downtown Anderson ( played by Walt Goggins  )  for a promotion to  \" the Show .  \"   ^\n\nWith the help of former major leaguers  Pedro Cerrano ( Dennis Haysbert  )  , Rube Baker ( Eric Bruskotter  )  , and Isuro  Tanaka ( Takaaki Ishibashi  )  , Gus gets the Buzz on the right track .   ^\n\nIn  fact  , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous  manager of the big-league club  , Leonard Huff ( played with over-the-top  relish by Ted McGinley  ) .   ^\n\nSoon  , Dorn has arranged an exhibition game  that pits Gus  \' overachieving group against Huff \'s   overpaid  , last-place  bunch .  ^\n\nWH  : Can we guess who wins  ?  ^\n\nJB  :  The results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a  game when you \'ve   already seen the box score .   ^\n\nOn top of that  , none of  the mock-ups are presented with much flair .   ^\n\nThey \'re   not just boring  ;  they \'re   lackluster .   ^\n\nBut the MAJOR LEAGUE movies have never been about  drama or tension  ; they \'ve   been about using baseball situations to  generate laughs .  ^\n\nHC  :  Warren fouls off a fastball .   ^\n\n1 and 1 .  ^\n\nWH  :  Are there lots of yuks in this one  ?  ^\n\nJB  :  Not one  , from start to finish .   ^\n\nI enjoyed the first MAJOR LEAGUE  because it was reasonably fresh and funny .   ^\n\nOkay  , a lot of the jokes  were sophomoric  , but they made me laugh .   ^\n\nThe two sequels have n\'t   just  been stale  , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low .   ^\n\nEven Bob  Uecker \'s   once-sharp one-liners have turned lame  , and they \'re   the closest  the film comes to being even vaguely amusing .  ^\n\nHC  :  Here \'s   the 1-1 pitch .   ^\n\nLooooooong drive fair or foul  Foul Ball  !    ^\n\nThe count goes to 1 and 2 .  ^\n\nWH  :  Does the film at least get the baseball details correct  ?

  ^\n\nLike  Cerrano  , Tanaka  , and Dorn .  ^\n\nJB  :  Depends on whether you really care that anyone is back .  ^\n\nThere  are n\'t   any real characters here  just an assortment of cliched  oddballs .   ^\n\nYeah  , the voodoo hitter  , the catcher who ca n\'t   throw back to  the pitcher  , the Japanese player  , and the conceited player-turned-owner  have all returned  , but who really cares  ?

 ^\n\nJB  :  That \'s   right .   ^\n\nTo use baseball terminology  , it \'s   a three-pitch  strikeout .   ^\n\nIf you \'re   looking for a good movie that involves baseball  ,  try popping THE NATURAL  , FIELD OF DREAMS  , BULL DURHAM  , or even the first  MAJOR LEAGUE into the VCR .   ^\n\nActually  , this is an oddly-timed release  ,  since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in  theaters .   ^\n\nEven the minor league seasons are already underway .   ^\n\nDo n\'t    bother with MAJOR LEAGUE  : BACK TO THE MINORS .  ^\n\nIt \'s   a wretched time- waster .  ^\n\nWH  : Thanks for the advice .  ^\n\nJB  :  You \'re   welcome .  ^\n\nHC  :  And here \'s   the 2-2 pitch .   ^\n\nFouled back  , right into this booth .    ^\n\nHey  , Jim  , heads up  !   ^\n\nOops .   ^\n\nSomebody better get him some ice for that .    ^\n\nHe may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies  , but he needs to learn  not to duck into foul balls .   ^\n\nOdd how Warren seemed to aim that ball  right at him  , almost as if he has a grudge to settle .   ^\n\nAnyway  , back to  the action on the field '
cv424_9268.txt,'It \'s   time to take cover .   ^\n\nAfter a hiatus of about fifteen years  , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest .   ^\n\nIn early 1997  , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone  , one on television and two in the theaters  , with DANTE \'S   PEAK and VOLCANO in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar .   ^\n\nOf the two  , I had heard that DANTE \'S   PEAK was the better film  , so I decided to check it out when it was released on video .  ^\n\nThe film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town .   ^\n\nThe town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption .   ^\n\nFlaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky  , crushing homes and people .   ^\n\nWe see people panicking  , people crying  , and even horses rearing .   ^\n\nIt is a disaster of biblical proportions  , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road .   ^\n\nSymbolism does n\'t   get much more blatant than that .  ^\n\nWe learn that Harry Dalton ( Pierce Brosnan  )  , a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey  , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred .   ^\n\nHarry survived  , but his wife did not .   ^\n\nA few years later  , Harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of Dante \'s   Peak  , Washington ( which  , we are told  , has been voted Second Most Desirable Place to Live ( Under 20,000  ) by the readers of Money Magazine  ) .   ^\n\nThere Harry meets Rachel Wando  , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of Dante \'s   Peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop .   ^\n\nAlthough the mayor does n\'t   seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up  , a few members of the city council are .   ^\n\nThey are afraid that Harry \'s   presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing Dante \'s   Peak .   ^\n\nThey would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug .  ^\n\nHowever  , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs  , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath .   ^\n\nThus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption .  ^\n\nThis film contains a number of cliches .   ^\n\nThe amorous couple is one .  ^\n\nAs soon as they doff their clothes  , you know they \'re   going to die .  ^\n\nThe town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances  , as does the death-defying dog .   ^\n\nCountless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable .   ^\n\nWatching the movie  , I was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements  , but some of the dialogue as well .   ^\n\nUnfortunate  , since much of the dialog is terrible .  ^\n\nFor example  , Harry \'s   boss  , Paul ( Charles Hallahan  )  ,  and a team from the U.S. Geological Survey join Harry to assess the situation .   ^\n\nPaul basically tells the townsfolk that Harry \'s   eruption predictions are n\'t   cause for alarm .   ^\n\nThis causes Harry to leave in a fit of rage  , only to turn up the next day  , ready for work .   ^\n\nWhen Paul asks Harry why he stayed  , he says with grim determination  ,  \" Cause this town \'s   in trouble and I \'m   the best man you \'ve   got .  \"   ^\n\nEven better is when Harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving .   ^\n\nHe likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water .   ^\n\nIf the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up  , however  , the frog wo n\'t   move and will allow itself to be cooked .   ^\n\n\" Is that your recipe for frog soup  ?  \" asks one of the team members .   ^\n\n\" It \'s   my recipe for disaster  ,  \" responds Harry .  ^\n\nDANTE \'S   PEAK has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious .   ^\n\nOur heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which Harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid .   ^\n\nMayor Wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming  , in a very grave tone  ,  \" Acid eats metal .  \"   ^\n\nThanks for the tip .   ^\n\nWhen we first see the U.S. Geological Survey building  , there \'s   a caption labeling it as such .  ^\n\nThis would n\'t   have been so bad if it were n\'t   for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads  , in large letters  ,  \" U.S. Geological Survey .  \"   ^\n\nI suppose the caption is for people who ca n\'t   read signs .  ^\n\nAlthough Harry and Mayor Wando become an item by the end of the film  , the viewer has no idea why .   ^\n\nThere is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters  , and the relationship seems rushed because of this .   ^\n\nWhen they get close to kissing  , I was asking myself  ,  \" Why do they want to kiss  ?   ^\n\nWere they even attracted to each other  ?  \"   ^\n\nIf I were the mayor  , I would sure think twice about kissing a guy who does n\'t   even crack a smile through the whole movie  , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act .   ^\n\nWho does he think he is  ?   ^\n\nJames Bond  ?  ^\n\nThe eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed .   ^\n\nThere are several  \" warning signs  \" prior to the eruption itself  , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we do n\'t   feel as if they are leading up to anything .   ^\n\nFor example  , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot .   ^\n\nA tremor occurs .   ^\n\nDoes he plunge headlong to his death  ?   ^\n\nIs he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below  ?   ^\n\nNo  , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg .   ^\n\nThe sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene  , which I suppose was intended to be dramatic as well .   ^\n\nIt was n\'t   .^\n\nOne plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of Dante \'s   Peak .   ^\n\nIn a disaster movie  , there \'s   usually one guy who \'s   greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite  , and usually gets killed by the disaster .   ^\n\nIt \'s   okay  , of course  , because we all think he got what he deserved .   ^\n\nIf you \'re   going to be unoriginal  , you might as well go all the way .   ^\n\nIn DANTE \'S   PEAK  , the city councilmembers are concerned  , but they do n\'t   really try hard enough .  ^\n\nMaybe the mayor \'s   abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one .  ^\n\nFor no apparent reason  , she snaps at Harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt .   ^\n\nPerhaps her ancestors invested in some Pompeii real estate .  ^\n\nThere are a couple of good things about this movie .   ^\n\nThe first is the scenery .   ^\n\nThere are panoramic shots of forests  , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful .   ^\n\nThe second is the special effects .  ^\n\nThey are the closest I \'ve   ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption .  ^\n\nBut when elements which do n\'t   speak are going to be the best parts of your movie  , you \'d   probably better rewrite the script .

cv425_8603.txt,'CAPSULE: A ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as    entertainment, so muddled it doesn\'t even know what it\'s really advocating,    if anything.    ^\n\nA TIME TO KILL has been hailed as the best of the Grisham adaptations , and    it \'s  easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it    is full of good actors ( Samuel L. Jackson , Matthew McConaughey , Sandra    Bullock , Kevin Spacey , Charles Dutton ) ; and it \'s  ostensibly about some    important social issue that we \'re  all tangling with .^\n\nIt is not , however , a    good movie , and all of the reasons I \'ve  listed above have something to do    with why .    ^\n\nRight from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as    thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible .^\n\nA pair of redneck whites , boozed    and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape    her horribly , and leave her for dead .^\n\nAfter their arrest , their father    ( Jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial .   ^\n\nMcConaughey  is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow    strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics .    ^\n\nThe acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have .^\n\nSandra    Bullock  ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ;    Spacey \'s  accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he \'s  given a    totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ;    and McConaughey \'s  role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box .   ^\n\nThe most memorable role is Donald Sutherland \'s  , and his is a bit part .    ^\n\nI always consider it an index of a movie \'s  desperation when it is able to    present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate    an ounce of impact .^\n\nThere is one scene --  a riot outside the courtroom --     that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a    textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this .^\n\nBecause the movie    does n\'t  know what it \'s  really about , it ca n\'t  generate any genuine tension ,    and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting .^\n\nOne of    the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of    vicious KKK cross-burners --  which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on    the nihilistic .^\n\nI was reminded of the despicable BETRAYED , which tried to    tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of    racism as little more than an attention-getter .    ^\n\nThe movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few    critical mistakes .^\n\nFirst of all , the Jackson character is not hard to judge ;    there \'s  no tension in his dilemma .^\n\nHe \'s  self-admittedly guilty and should be    sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade .^\n\nThe old saw about how no    court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the    underlying theme of the movie , but it \'s  never developed into an organic    component of the story .^\n\nIt just sort of floats around on top while the movie    grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics .    ^\n\nAnother mistake is in motivational logic : By not having the two white thugs    arraigned FIRST --  or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence ,    say --  we have that much less empathy for Jackson \'s  character .^\n\nI \'m  probably    supposed  to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are    automatically supposed to feel empathy for him , but that \'s  precisely the    kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible .^\n\n( See THE VIRGIN    SPRING for more on that note . )^\n\nIs Jackson \'s  character then simply insane ?

cv427_11693.txt,'\" Mandingo  \" has traditionally been seen as one of two things  : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the South  , or in the words of film critic Leonard Maltin  ,  \" a trashy potboiler  \" that  \" appeals only to the S&M crowd .  \"  ^\n\nActually  , I think  \" Mandingo  \" is a strange combination of the two  , although it fails on both fronts .  ^\n\nIt \'s   too trashy to be good drama  , but too dramatic to be good trash .  ^\n\nThe story takes place on a dilapidated Louisiana plantation run by crotchety old Warren Maxwell ( James Mason  ) and his son  , Hammond ( Perry King  ) .  ^\n\nOne day in New Orleans  , Hammond comes across a slave trader selling a Mandingo named Mede ( heavyweight boxer Ken Norton  ) .  ^\n\nAlthough the movie never explains it  , a Mandingo is simply the name for Africans who come from the region of the upper Niger River valley .  ^\n\nAccording to the movie  , Mandingos were the Rolls Royce of African slaves .  ^\n\nHammond pays top price for Mede and has to fight off others in order to get him .  ^\n\nHammond then spends his time training Mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves .  ^\n\nMeanwhile  , Hammond has married his cousin  , Blanche ( Susan George  )  , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild .  ^\n\nHammond  , however  , is happier spending nights with his  \" bed wench  ,  \" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex .  ^\n\nIt is quickly apparent that Hammond  , despite his overt racism  , is more in love with his bed wench  , a sensitive slave girl named Ellen ( Brenda Sykes  )  , than he is with Blanche .  ^\n\nHammond considers Blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had  \" pleasured  \" her before he did .  ^\n\nOf course  , it \'s   fine that he \'s   slept with numerous slave girls  , but the fact that his wife  , a  \" white lady  ,  \" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her .  ^\n\nSo Blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while Hammond is sleeping with Ellen .  ^\n\nBlanche gets back at Hammond by seducing the studly Mede and bearing his child .  ^\n\nHammond and his father cannot stand the idea that Blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it \'s   okay that Ellen was pregnant by Hammond  )  , so Warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth  , and Hammond poisons Blanche .  ^\n\nHammond then finds Mede  , shoots him twice in the shoulder  , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water .  ^\n\nYes  , you read right  : the film ends with Hammond getting his revenge by boiling Mede alive .  ^\n\nJudging only by the plot  ,  \" Mandingo  \" is pure sexploitation .  ^\n\nThe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible  , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century Southern society .  ^\n\nWhen  \" Mandingo  \" was released in 1975  , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail  ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs .  ^\n\nDramatically  ,  \" Mandingo  \" is weak and unfocused  , and historically it \'s   mostly confused .  ^\n\nIf one were to judge history by this film  , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of American slavery was based on sexuality  , not economics .  ^\n\nNot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working  , except for a few house servants .  ^\n\nThe men spend most of the time sitting around  , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner .  ^\n\nThere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves  , but  \" Mandingo \'s    \" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there \'s   plenty of violence --   fights  , vicious beatings  , shootings  , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence --   thrown in for good measure  ) .  ^\n\nSome tried to write off  \" Mandingo  \" as a blaxploitation film  , one of a number of quickly-made  , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies  , but it \'s   not that easy .  ^\n\n\" Mandingo  \" was studio-financed by Paramount Pictures  , and produced by Dino De Laurentiis  , the grandiose Italian producer behind such notorious productions as  \" The Bible  \" ( 1966  )  , the remake of  \" King Kong  \" ( 1976  )  , and the ill-fated  \" Dune  \" ( 1984  ) .  ^\n\nThe director was Richard Fleischer  , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including  \" 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea  \" ( 1954  ) and  \" Fantastic Voyage  \" ( 1966  )  , as well as such superior suspense films as  \" The Narrow Margin  \" ( 1952  ) .  ^\n\nThe script  , based on the supermarket best-seller by Ken Ostott ( and the subsequent play by Jack Kirkland  )  , was penned by Norman Wexler  , who had been nominated for an Oscar two years earlier for his work on  \" Serpico .  \"  ^\n\nJames Mason  , Perry King  , and Susan George were well-known and respected actors ( Mason already had three Oscar nominations under his belt  )  , and Ken Norton appeared to have a promising film career .  ^\n\nSo why is  \" Mandingo  \" so bad  ?  ^\n\nA number of reasons  , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job .  ^\n\nWexler \'s   script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive  ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk (  \" Yessuh  , massuh  \"  )  , stereotyped Southern white trash talk (  \" Fer whut \'re   you gittin \' outta bed  ?  \"  )  , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk (  \" If you see me hang  , you gonna know you killed a black brother  !  \"  ) .  ^\n\nFleischer \'s   direction is clumsy  , especially during the fight scenes  , and all the actors give weak performances  , especially Susan George whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable .  ^\n\nNevertheless  , credit should be given where credit is due .  ^\n\nDespite its exploitative nature  ,  \" Mandingo  \" was one of the first Hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery .  ^\n\nUntil then  , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all Hollywood films dealing with slavery .  ^\n\nEven classics such as  \" Gone With the Wind  \" ( 1939  ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter .  ^\n\n\" Mandingo  \" reassessed the South  , and showed that it was n\'t   all beautiful plantations  , green fields  , and pretty sunsets .  ^\n\nBut all this is constantly undermined by the film \'s   negligible point-of-view --   it claims to see things from the black perspective  , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners .  ^\n\nWith a little more maturity and different handling  ,  \" Mandingo  \" might have been an effective  , worthwhile film .  ^\n\nWhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery  , it never deals with them .  ^\n\nThe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile  , but Wexler \'s   script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing .  ^\n\nThere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner  , but  \" Mandingo  \" never does it .  ^\n\nSteven Spielberg touched on that same topic in  \" Schindler \'s   List  \" ( 1993  )  , by looking at a Nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a Jewish maid .  ^\n\nThe difference between that film and  \" Mandingo  \" is that Spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair  , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma .  ^\n\n\" Mandingo  \" is satisfied to simply show some skin  , and because of that  , its  \" trashy potboiler  \" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished .'

overbearing .   ^\n\nHis music sounds like it came straight out of a Vincent Price movie in certain scenes .   ^\n\nAt other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic .   ^\n\nOne sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue wo n\'t   reach its intended target .   ^\n\nMission to Mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme .   ^\n\nEvents are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience .   ^\n\nWe are apparently supposed to be upset that Tim Robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife  , but I felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest .   ^\n\nWhat makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that Robbins  \' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle  , except to invoke an emotional response ( I could think of at least ONE way to save him  , and the NASA clowns in this film are supposed to be  \" smarter  \" than I am  ) .   ^\n\nDuring the finale  , when we are finally introduced to the translucent  , conehead  , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from  , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish CGI ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of Air Force One or the Hell scenes in Spawn  ) .   ^\n\nA brief history lesson about  \" where we came from  \" is proffered  , then Sinise is whisked away to be with  \" the rest of our people  \" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that  \" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has  \"  ).  >From the press I \'ve   been seeing this film receive  , it is apparent that Mission to Mars will be dying a quick death at the theater .   ^\n\nI \'m   sure the first weekend or two will be huge  , but once word gets out people will stop going .   ^\n\nLet \'s   just hope the upcoming Red Planet is better than this and is n\'t   hurt by the negativity this film is generating .   ^\n\nI \'d   venture to say it wo n\'t   be worse than this waste of time  .'
cv438_8500.txt,'RETROSPECTIVE  : CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD ( 1980  )   ^\n\nI once heard someone describe the films of Italian schlock horror director Lucio Fulci as  \" dim-witted  \" .   ^\n\nAnd by golly  , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD .  ^\n\nAlthough the late Fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career  , this is not one of them .   ^\n\nTwo points in the movie \'s   favour - the impressive camerawork of Sergio Salvati and occasionally evocative score by Fabio Frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss  , but by and large CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD is a failure .   ^\n\nAnd like most cinematic failures  , it comes down to bad writing  , dumb performances and lousy direction .  ^\n\nThe story starts in New York when  , during a seance  , a medium ( Katherine McColl  ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of Dunwich  , Massachusetts .   ^\n\nFor reasons we wo n\'t   go into here  , this opens the gates of Hell which must be closed by All Saints Day or the dead will rise and walk the earth .   ^\n\nThe medium apparently dies of fright during the seance  , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( Christopher George  ) .   ^\n\nThat scene in itself is a howler  : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside  ?  ^\n\nAnd do n\'t   cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they \'re   buried  ?   ^\n\nAnyway  , off the two of them go to Dunwich to save the world  , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as All Saints Day approaches .  ^\n\nFulci \'s   graphic gore is in evidence once again  , but here it only serves to further highlight the film \'s   flimsy script and plodding direction .   ^\n\nThe dialogue  , in all manner of speaking  , is unspeakable .  ^\n\nNot bad in the quotable sense  , like an Ed Wood film  , but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious  \" lets explain the plot  \" type approach .   ^\n\nMcColl does n\'t   have a clue who her character is  : deadly serious one minute  , frivolous the next  , she at times is genuinely hard to watch .   ^\n\nAnd the geezer ( the actor \'s   name escapes me  ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than McColl as the film progresses .   ^\n\nChristopher George \'s   performance is salvageable  , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we do n\'t   care .   ^\n\nIn fact we do n\'t   care for anyone in CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD  , though in other Fulci films that has n\'t   mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man  , as he was in THE BEYOND .  ^\n\nAs a director  , some of Fulci \' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here .   ^\n\nHe constantly uses extreme close-ups of people \'s   eyes  , a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors are n\'t   capable of .   ^\n\nAnd despite some gruesome violence  , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film .   ^\n\nLong-time collaborator Fabio Frizzi  , talented but always erratic  , offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie  , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that \'s   quite frankly embarrassing .  ^\n\nFulci \'s   other films of this period may be flawed - HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY  , THE BEYOND  , THE BLACK CAT - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration  , atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey .   ^\n\nFor completists only  .'

Dippe The makers of Spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer \'s   other comic book adaptation  , Batman and Robin .  ^\n\nBoth films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts  , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations .  ^\n\nIn panel-sized morsels  , implausible plots and  \" Rambo\"-esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork  , but on thirty foot silver screens  , it \'s   much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures .  ^\n\nSpawn is ostensibly about an assassin named Simmons ( White  ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by Sheen  )  , then set on fire and left for dead .  ^\n\nThough the movie skimps on the next few plot points  , here \'s   what I could determine  : said assassin then becomes the leader of Satan \'s   army  , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named Clown ( Leguizamo  , grating as always  ) .  ^\n\nHe is renamed  , for reasons unbeknownst  , Spawn  , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon .  ^\n\nBut when Spawn spies on a birthday party for his child  , he realizes that he ca n\'t   be the evil superdemon he \'s   expected to be  , and he sets about avenging his untimely death .  ^\n\nTypical of summer blockbusters  , Spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video .  ^\n\nWhile the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of The Lawnmower Man  )  , Spawn \'s   prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold .  ^\n\nBut the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( Spawn longs for his wife  , but they do n\'t   have a single scene together before Simmons  \' death  !  )  , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody \'s   guess  )  , and believability ( not that I expected it  ) .  ^\n\nSo many questions are left unanswered  , and I \'m   sure they wo n\'t   be addressed in the inevitable sequel .  ^\n\nWhile last year \'s   The Crow  : City of Angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent  )  , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power .  ^\n\nSpawn is an in-your-face  , screaming banshee of a film  ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid  , but they have n\'t   the faintest idea how to make a movie  .'

Fox  )  , who have never met .   ^\n\nTo make a long story short  , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by Nikki \'s   obsession with safe sex .   ^\n\nFirst she wants condoms  , so Bunz and Rushon go out and get them .   ^\n\nOh  , no  , they have to be latex  , not lambskin .   ^\n\nBack to the store .   ^\n\nNow they \'ve   got to get dental dams  , or there \'ll   be no foreplay .   ^\n\nWhy are both couples stopped each time Nikki makes a demand  ?   ^\n\nNikki phones Lysterine  , who lives across the hall  , and tells her she \'d   better be making these demands  , too .   ^\n\nTalk about coitus interruptus .  ^\n\nBOOTY CALL is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies .   ^\n\nThe difference between the two is that in the latter  , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality .   ^\n\nIn this category  , for example  , you have ACE VENTURA  : PRIVATE EYE on the mild side  , and AIRPLANE  ! at the extreme .   ^\n\nThere are times during BOOTY CALL where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status  , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention .   ^\n\nIt is disappointing  , and even worse  , distracting .  ^\n\nThere are also instances where the screenplay by Takashi Bufford and Bootsie Parker ( are those real names  ?  ) does not live up to its potential  , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing .   ^\n\nFor instance  , there is a scene where our main characters are in a Chinese restaurant .   ^\n\nBunz goes up to an Asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent Cantonese  , much to everyone \'s   surprise .   ^\n\nHowever  , when asked how he learned the language  , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films  , and soon gained mastery .   ^\n\nThis negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene .   ^\n\nIf  , on the other hand  , when asked how he learned to speak Chinese  , Bunz simply replied with  ,  \" kung-fu movies  ,  \" and then moved on  , the joke would have been much more effective .   ^\n\nThis is because it would have been totally unbelievable  , but funny because we know it is unbelievable .   ^\n\nBy explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible  , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit .  ^\n\nThe inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions .   ^\n\nWhy are two such disparate people like Bunz and Rushon best friends  ?   ^\n\nWhy do Rushon and Nikki fix up Bunz and Lysterine  ?   ^\n\nIf Nikki is so obsessed with safe sex  , why does n\'t   she have some condoms at her own apartment  ?   ^\n\nThese questions are not answered by the screenplay  , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward .  ^\n\nA very noticeable quality of BOOTY CALL is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language .   ^\n\nSome movies use a lot of swear words  , but use them under very justifiable circumstances  , as when they are employed consistent with a character \'s   pattern of speech .   ^\n\nOther films  , such as the recent JACKIE BROWN  , use them in ways that almost parody themselves .   ^\n\nBOOTY CALL just sticks them in to get laughs  , and it does n\'t   work .   ^\n\nThey stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them .  ^\n\nHalf of the scenes seem to occur for no reason .   ^\n\nThe Chinese restaurant  , a holdup at a convenience store  , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story  , and are in there for filler .   ^\n\nThis is surprising  , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long .   ^\n\nIt \'s   too bad that the core of the film is n\'t   much better  , since it is comprised of sometimes funny  , but forgettable dialog .   ^\n\nI refer you to the first paragraph of this review .

cv454_21961.txt,'Retelling the classic story of Joan of Arc has been a popular trend this    year.^\n\nEarlier this May , Leelee Sobieski played the passionate title role in    the top-rated miniseries that debuted on CBS .^\n\nAnd now , director Luc Besson    has  delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl    supposedly sent by God to rescue France from the clutches of their enemies .   ^\n\nStarring Milla Jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly    messenger accused of being a witch , `The Messenger : The Story of Joan of    Arc\' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails    merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend .    ^\n\nBesson ( who \'s  previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `The Fifth    Element\' )  perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife Jovovich ,    because in `The Messenger\' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own    inexperience .^\n\nAt first , when reports were indicating that Jovovich had been    chosen for such a demanding role , I was highly doubtful that her marginal    talent  could carry a film of such a caliber .^\n\nAfter seeing the rousing    trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - Milla Jovovich looked    superb . ^\n\nWith  the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `The    Messenger\' looked like a timeless epic in the making .    ^\n\nA timeless epic it is not .^\n\nBesson is hesitant to abandon his unique and    flashy style , and the story behind `The Messenger\' is not entirely suited to    his demands .^\n\nOn the shoulders of Besson \'s  choppy and unexciting direction ,    the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle    sequences  and bizarre imagery .^\n\nThere is no human exploration into the    character of Joan ( or Jeanne ) .^\n\nJovovich merely rambles on about the power of    God  when  we  have little or no insight into her visionary objective .   ^\n\nJovivich \'s  unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that    Besson sees Jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard .^\n\nShe is just another    special effect in this continuous visual feast .    ^\n\nJovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she    looks  lost . ^\n\nQuite  frankly ,  I  do n\'t   know of any actress who could    successfully  navigate her way through `The Messenger\' without a major    fumble .^\n\nThe script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate    comedy , as Jeanne confronts the uncrowned King Charles VII ( John Malkovich )    and informs him of her heavenly intentions .^\n\nFaye Dunaway plays Charles \'    overbearing mother-in-law , and Dustin Hoffman appears over two-hours into    the story as a character dubbed The Conscience\' .^\n\nAll three actors juggle    limited screen time , although Malkovich is uncharacteristically awful .    ^\n\nThe  battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such    jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of    something like `Braveheart\' .^\n\nThere \'s  a particularly graphic and unsettling    scene early on , when Jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a    closet  as  her  older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a    bloodthirsty English soldier .^\n\nEven his fellow troopers are petrified.     `The Messenger\' is also strictly a 90\'s  update on the classic story .^\n\nAlmost    too 90\'s  , it seems .^\n\nThere \'s  gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of    slang terms like `she \'s  nuts!\' sprinkled throughout the screenplay .^\n\nI was    half-expecting Jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it    never happened .^\n\nThere \'s  also the familiar presence of bizarre Besson humor ,    but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly .^\n\nIt seems    terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `The    Messenger\' , almost everything does .    ^\n\nThe musical score by Erric Serra is spectacular , and the set and production    designs are continuously impressive .^\n\nIf it was visual excellence that Besson    was striving for , then he achieves his goal .^\n\nBut the only time the dramatics    come alive in `The Messenger\' is during the closing trial , in which Jeanne    is  found  guilty  and  burned at the stake .^\n\nDuring these moments , the    historical  relevance  and dramatic purpose of Joan of Arc reaches the    audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or    meaning . ^\n\nIt \'s   just  too  delayed  for  Besson to revive his lifeless    interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects.     `The Messenger : The Story of Joan of Arc\' is an unlikely and unwelcome    historical  addition  to  the Hollywood shelf .^\n\nAnyone searching for an    entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and    confusing film .^\n\nDespite my original hopefulness , Milla Jovovich is not going    to have to worry about thanking the Academy .    ^\n\n'

 ) .  ^\n\nI have to say here that I knew exactly what I was getting into going into this film .   ^\n\nThere \'s   not a frame of promotional footage I have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good .   ^\n\nIn this respect  , the film never disappointed me .   ^\n\nThis film reaches a level that transcends the  \" so bad it \'s   good  \" level and borders on the downright insane .   ^\n\nThe effects are awful  , the script is contrived  , and for most of the feature I was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( I think  ) .   ^\n\nI challenge anyone to sit through the scene  , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner  , with a straight face .  ^\n\nThankfully  , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with .   ^\n\nDina Meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( Johnny Mnemonic  , Dragonheart  , and Starship Troopers   ... the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit  )  , and this one is no exception .   ^\n\nWhile one never really gets the impression that Meyer \'s   character could be a bat expert in reality  , one never really cares to doubt it either .   ^\n\nShe gives as good a performance as could be expected  , plus she \'s   nice to look at for an hour and a half .   ^\n\nLou Diamond Phillips is also serviceable here  , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero .   ^\n\nAlthough when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what \'s   going on in town  , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats .   ^\n\nThe only bad performance in the film is that of Leon \'s   . ^\n\nHe is relegated to the  \" I \'m   not sticking around here  !  \" character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays .  ^\n\nAnyone who ca n\'t   immediately tell that Bob Gunton ( the bad guy in Patch Adams and countless other films  ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised  , but I highly doubt it .   ^\n\nEven if he had n\'t   been the villain in just about every film he \'s   ever been in  , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever .   ^\n\nIn fact  , his death is welcome  , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale .  ^\n\nIf the plot does n\'t   sound ridiculous to you yet  , then check out these little tidbits  : A multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol .   ^\n\nAn entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor \'s   orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated  , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force  , killing several townsfolk .   ^\n\nA government official blows off Shelia \'s   instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats  \' cave that will kill all of them off  ) by pulling a night job  , resulting in the death of an entire military unit .   ^\n\nA cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it .   ^\n\nFinally  , to top it all off  , this little Texas town is showing Nosferatu in it \'s   single screen theater ( for reference  , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens  , and we \'re   lucky to even get Kevin Smith \'s   Dogma  ) .  ^\n\nThe most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets .   ^\n\nWhile the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what \'s   going on  )  , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key .   ^\n\nTherefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic  , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film .   ^\n\nBeing able to see the puppeteer \'s   arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse .  ^\n\nAfter all of this  , if you still decide Bats might be the movie for you  , do n\'t   say you have n\'t   been warned .   ^\n\nTrust me when I say that it \'s   a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through .   ^\n\nI just wish that Dina Meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in .   ^\n\nShe \'s   definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these .

  ^\n\nThe editing by Steven Weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times .  ^\n\nThe real offender here is screenwriter Gerald Di Pego .   ^\n\nWorking from a best- selling novel by Nicholas Sparks ( which I have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as The Bridges of Madison County  )  , Di Pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times .   ^\n\nIts strict adherence to clichs brings to mind such disasters as I Still Know What You Did Last Summer ( 1998  ) .   ^\n\nThere simply is n\'t   an original scene in this film .   ^\n\nThe dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking .  ^\n\nThis is director Mandoki \'s   first film since When a Man Loves a Woman ( 1994  )  , the solid Meg Ryan/Andy Garcia romance .   ^\n\nHe \'s   simply going through the motions with this .  ^\n\nMessage In a Bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with What Dreams May Come ( 1998  ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade  .'

cv466_20092.txt,'The movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence  , rather cool and sets the mood for things to come .  ^\n\nThe story propels the audience into a neo-reality  ; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red. eXisTenZ is actually the name of a new virtual-reality game .  ^\n\nSupposedly  , VR games are highly popular as is considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality. **** ( Leigh  ) is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game-experience in the form of eXisTenZ .  ^\n\nPlayers are required to have bio-ports embedded in their spine  , which plugs to a game-pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience .  ^\n\nDuring a secretive beta-testing-cum-teaser meeting for this new game  , an assassination attempt on *** life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard *** ( Law  ). *** is more of a realists than anything else  , afraid that he \'ll   lose reality if he begin to play these games but *** requires his help to immerse together with her into eXisTenZ to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt .  ^\n\nAs they soon discover  , they are transported between realities within eXisTenZ  uncovering more than they initially expected. eXisTenZ has all the Cronenberg-gore that is expected of him .  ^\n\nEven so  , this film is no-where near his cult classics such as Videodrome or Scanners .  ^\n\nNot even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful The Fly. eXisTenz can probably be looked upon as his 90 \'s   version of Videodrome  , even so  , it is a poor follow-up .  ^\n\nWhile in most of his famed films  , his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot .  ^\n\nIn eXisTenz  , the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over-indulgence than anything else .  ^\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law  , both commendable actors  , looked aloof and miss-directed throughout the entire film .  ^\n\nThe scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the B-grade category .  ^\n\nIt was obvious that Cronenberg worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film ( the opening sequence  , though  , probably formed a considerable portion of the budget  !  ) which is actually quite good. eXisTenZ is too predictable and cliched in these times .  ^\n\n10 years ago  , it would have been another classic for Cronenberg .  ^\n\nCronenberg fans however  , ( those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film  ) should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you  .'

cv478_15921.txt,'There is a scene in Patch Adams in which Patch is in the center of a courtroom  , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors .  ^\n\nWhen I noticed that the audience with whom I saw this film was reacting the same way  , I realized that I was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture .  ^\n\nYou see  , Patch Adams revolted me beyond all boundaries .  ^\n\nI hated this movie for every second that I sat watching it  , and I actively hate it now  , days later  , with the simpering  , superficial  , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories .  ^\n\nI hate every element of the film  , beginning with Tom Shadyac \'s   shameless direction  , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey .  ^\n\nThe badness of Patch Adams is stupefying .  ^\n\nIt \'s   confounding .  ^\n\nI ca n\'t   believe a film can be this bad .  ^\n\nAnd yet  , it \'s   based on a real man who probably has a good point to make .   ^\n\nIn the film  , Patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable Robin Williams  , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that I wonder now if he is even human .   ^\n\nIn the beginning of the film  , Patch commits himself to a mental institution because he does n\'t   want to kill himself .   ^\n\nWhile there  , he notices that the doctors do n\'t   care about the patients  , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings .  ^\n\nSo  , Patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients .   ^\n\nHe goes to medical school  , where he meets Truman ( Daniel London  ) and convinces him that it \'s   good to help people .   ^\n\nHe also meets Carin Fischer ( Monica Potters  )  , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor .   ^\n\nNaturally  , the dean of the medical school ( Bob Gunton  ) hates Patch  , and wants to thwart his plans  , even though Patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams .   ^\n\nSo Patch decides that he \'s   going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have .  ^\n\nAnd that  , my friends  , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 .   ^\n\nOn a superficial level  , the film is not particularly bad  :  I would n\'t   say the cinematography bothered me  , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what Shadyac was aiming for ( I actually liked Potter \'s   performance  , even if she is wasted  ) .   ^\n\nBut the film fails fundamentally in execution .   ^\n\nEvery scene swells with grand  ,  \" emotional  \" music  , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard .   ^\n\nTake  , for instance  , the first scene  , which shows Patch sitting on a bus .   ^\n\nWe do n\'t   know Patch yet  , but there \'s   sad music  , and it \'s   supposed to make us really sad that he \'s   sad .   ^\n\nLater on  , Patch makes a lot of progress  :  he helps a dying patient ( Peter Coyote  ) to enjoy the last days of his life  , and the music as Patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively .   ^\n\nAnd when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert  !  )  , the music is very very sad .  ^\n\nBut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions .   ^\n\nReal drama is character-based .   ^\n\nYou grow to like someone  , and then something bad happens  , and you feel it .   ^\n\nWe do n\'t   ever grow to know the dying patient  ; he \'s   simply a vehicle for Patch \'s   greatness .   ^\n\nReal drama does n\'t   seem forced  , or present just to make the audience cry .   ^\n\nThat \'s   why Patch Adams is not real drama .   ^\n\nIt goes for every cheap tear imaginable  , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene .   ^\n\nEven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in Marc Shaiman \'s   sickening musical score .  ^\n\nSentimentality like this is indeed bad .   ^\n\nBut it \'s   not as bad as half-baked  , simplistic themes .   ^\n\nYou see  , Patch is a really great student .   ^\n\nHe aces his tests without studying  , and does it so effectively that people think he \'s   cheating .   ^\n\nBut Patch does n\'t   think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor .   ^\n\n\" Why do n\'t   we see patients until the third year  ?  \" he bursts out every three seconds .   ^\n\nWell  , Patch  , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to LEARN SOMETHING before you go treating patients .   ^\n\nNot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort .   ^\n\nMost of us have to study .   ^\n\nAnd a doctor who really wants to help  , but does n\'t   know a toe from a finger  , probably wo n\'t   be too successful in preventing death .  ^\n\nOh wait  , I almost forgot  :  the point of doctors is not just to  \" prevent death  ,  \" but to  \" improve the quality of life  !  \"   ^\n\nYes  !   ^\n\nThat is true  !   ^\n\nAnd you can not do that without studying .   ^\n\nYou can not do that without going to medical school .   ^\n\nWhat Patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe  , just maybe  , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later .   ^\n\nFollow the rules  ?   ^\n\nBah  !   ^\n\nWho needs the rules  !   ^\n\nOnly uptight doctors follow the rules .   ^\n\nThe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants .    ^\n\nAnd then there \'s   the free clinic issue  , which I find shockingly  , frighteningly idealistic .   ^\n\nA free clinic .   ^\n\nIn the middle of the forest .   ^\n\nWhere patients can be taken to be helped .   ^\n\nFor free .   ^\n\nHow will patients be transported to the free clinic  ?   ^\n\nWill it have an emergency room  ?   ^\n\nOr is it just for mental patients  ?   ^\n\nAnd who  , may I ask  , will pay for it  ?   ^\n\nThe film does give some token attempts to question Patch \'s   motives ( I think another character asks him how he \'s   going to pay for it  , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about HMOs and medical insurance  )  , but they certainly do n\'t   explore or challenge Patch \'s   ideas to any meaningful extent .  ^\n\nReader  , please understand this  :  I am not making any kind of judgment on the real Patch Adams .   ^\n\nI know nothing about him .   ^\n\nIf his beliefs mirror those of this film character  , then I might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them .   ^\n\nBut regardless of what the real Patch Adams believes  , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony .   ^\n\nAnd in the last scene  , the big  , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus  , Patch does a lot of shouting .   ^\n\nActually  , Robin Williams does a lot of shouting .   ^\n\nHe shouts a lot about helping people  , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words .   ^\n\nI wo n\'t   tell you that you ca n\'t   be moved by his words  , because I  , too  , was moved by his words .   ^\n\nI was moved in such a profoundly negative way that I was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be .   ^\n\nPatch Adams is the cheapest of them all .

cv480_21195.txt,'As any reasonable human being would  , I must admit that occasionally I am befuddled by certain things .  ^\n\nI am befuddled by Fight Club .  ^\n\nNow sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later  , sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later .   ^\n\nPerhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time .  ^\n\nPerhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them .  ^\n\nFight Club is either garbage or brilliant  , but  , at least right now  , I must lean toward the former .  ^\n\nMaybe I am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold .  ^\n\nBut if it is  , I sure do n\'t  see it .  ^\n\nEdward Norton plays Jack  , a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer .  ^\n\nHis insomnia  , coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with IKEA furniture to \" complete \" himself  , make him a loser at the game of life .  ^\n\nBut when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window  , he seeks comfort in a stranger  , Tyler ( Pitt  ) whom he met on a flight home .  ^\n\nOnce Jack is sucked into Tyler \'s  world  , he ca n\'t  get out  , literally .  ^\n\nThey begin Fight Club  , an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging .  ^\n\nAs the Fight Club grows  , things get out of control and take on cult status  , beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside Tyler \'s  house for three days .  ^\n\nI dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film  , since that contains the twist that \" explains \" the pointless journey .  ^\n\nSuffice it to say I was truly disappointed in Fincher  , who \'s  previous two films  , Se7en and The Game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation .  ^\n\nThis is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table .  ^\n\nBut with Fight Club  , he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self-referencing film elements  , such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing  , telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good \" flashback humor \" .  ^\n\nNow  , throughout the film \'s  coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot lines  , Fight Club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today .  ^\n\nAdvertisements  , inter-office politics  , corporations  , you name it  , it \'s  addressed .  ^\n\n( Though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced .  )  ^\n\nAll of them play an important role .  ^\n\nHow so  ?  ^\n\nWell  , I can kinda just tell .  ^\n\nI ca n\'t  really put my finger on it .  ^\n\nTo say that Starbucks and Barnes & Noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news .  ^\n\nIs that bad for the world  ?  ^\n\nProbably .  ^\n\nNot much room for social commentary there .  ^\n\nWe all know that inter-office politics are just that  ... politics .  ^\n\nSo what was the point of all this  ?  ^\n\nThe film seems desperate to make a point  , or a number of points  , but I could n\'t  figure out what they were .  ^\n\nAll I saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques  , a bleak visual design and some fine acting .  ^\n\n( Pitt  , Carter  , Norton  ... all of them are good .  ^\n\nEven Meatloaf is good .  )  ^\n\nWhen you get to the end  , you will most likely be filled with questions  , many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself .  ^\n\nNot them  , because each of them would likely give you a different answer .  ^\n\nFight Club means what you want it to mean  , I think Fincher just gives you the stuff to think about .  ^\n\nBut it could n\'t  be more bizarre and unappealing .  ^\n\nSure  , it had shock value  , but so did Se7en and The Game  , and they were significantly stronger films  .'

cv483_18103.txt,'Movies  about  teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either    interesting, entertaining or convincing, because of one fundamental reason:    movies are made by adults and not teenagers.    ^\n\nOccasionally , however , films like Say Anything , Dazed And Confused and The    Breakfast Club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives    of those bizarre creatures which surround us called \" teenagers . \"^\n\nCa n\'t     Hardly Wait , however , does not .^\n\nInstead , the writing/directing team of Harry    Elfont and Deborah Kaplan manages to take every clich found in the teenage    genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it    into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences I have ever been    subjected to .    ^\n\nCa n\'t  Hardly Wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party    on the night of their high school graduation .^\n\nThe main characters are such    perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly    understand them : there \'s  the average male protagonist Preston ( Ethan Embry ) ,    prom queen and cheerleader Amanda ( Jennifer Love-Hewitt ) , football star Mike    ( Peter Facinelli ) , white rapper wannabe Kenny ( Seth Green ) , computer geek    William ( Charlie Korsmo ) , and brainy outsider Denise ( Lauren Ambrose ) .    ^\n\nI could n\'t  stand any of those characters .^\n\nWhether it was William getting    drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or Kenny proclaiming \" Yo , I    gotta have sex tonight ! \" , all I could think of was how Elfont and Kaplan    possibly managed to con Columbia Pictures out of ten million dollars to fund    their film .    ^\n\nApparently , Ca n\'t  Hardly Wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to    fail  in  this respect because of the fact that it \'s  not funny .^\n\nIn all    honesty , Elfont and Kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend    remedial classes in humour .^\n\nAnd when I say \" forced \" , I mean it .^\n\nThey should    be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar    fashion to Alex in A Clockwork Orange .^\n\nThis is how desperately they need to    be educated about the concept of humour .^\n\nFor instance , Ca n\'t  Hardly Wait    features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd    statements such as \" I am a sex machine . \"^\n\nFor some reason , Elfont and Kaplan    believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be    funny . ^\n\nIf  only Elfont and Kaplan could recognise the irony that they    actually got paid for making this junk - now that \'s  funny .    ^\n\n'
cv484_26169.txt,'WAY OF THE GUN is brimming with surprises, some good, most bad.^\n\nOne of the    good ones is Ryan Phillippe \'s  surprisingly halfway decent performance .^\n\nAfter    the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill    like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER , he hinted at a bit growth in last    year \'s  CRUEL INTENTIONS with his amusingly contemptuous John Malkovich meets    James Spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the    third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a    heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start    bellyaching about how he \'d  fallen for his \" target \" .^\n\nIt was a dramatic shift    that neither Phillippe nor the film \'s  director could negotiate .^\n\nBut he seems    to be trying and that should n\'t  be overlooked ( or probably over praised )    seeing as how , at this point , he really is n\'t  required to do much but look    pretty .^\n\nHere , Phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair    askew and his affect altered to sound something like James Cagney in all his    \" Look here , see \" glory .^\n\nIt \'s  tough to believe a pretty boy like Phillippe as    a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion .^\n\nUnlike Ben    Affleck \'s  puppy dog approach in REINDEER GAMES , Phillippe is believable and    not too bad at that .    ^\n\nAs for the plot , well , that \'s  one of the bad surprises ; Phillippe and the    great Benicio Del Torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable )    criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly    pick  a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a    surrogate mother ( Juliette Lewis ) after overhearing that she \'s  carrying the    baby of Painter ( Scott Wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man .^\n\nThe    kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and    many are killed .^\n\nBut the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging    hit man ( James Caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt )    remain in pursuit .    ^\n\nDirected by Christopher McQuarrie , the screenwriter who won an Oscar for his    work on USUAL SUSPECTS , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles    ( this one included ) , WAY OF THE GUN is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs    that just oozes eye rolling familiarity .^\n\nUnlike Phillipe , McQuarrie does n\'t     seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of    plot all snatched from movies I know I \'ve  seen before and worse , it feels    like it .^\n\nThe film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what Soderbergh did OUT    OF SIGHT or THE LIMEY ) to its clichs , all of which are spewed before us in a    picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to    notice how common it is .^\n\nIt features characters living by a code they seemed    to have picked up in Sam Peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling    life .^\n\nEven attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous    scene where enemies James Caan and Benicio Del Torro stop in their tracks to    have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc. I did n\'t  like    the bit much when it first appeared in HEAT , here , it \'s  even more self    consciously \" dramatic \" .    ^\n\nUSUAL SUSPECTS , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live    by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of    that astonishing twist ending .^\n\nNowadays an astonishing twist per ending is    de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely    inconsequential .^\n\nThus , nearly every character in WAY comes with at least one    dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it    too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in    the USUAL SUSPECTS ) but I admit , I did n\'t  see it coming , and I smiled .   ^\n\nHowever  most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes    between Palminteri and Spacey in USUAL SUSPECTS : a lot of faux huffing and    puffing with no rhythm or reason .^\n\nOr substance .    ^\n\nIt \'s  just as overplotted as SUSPECTS , and often dull as any overplotted    movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script    would be .^\n\nEven the good stuff , most of which involves James Caan ( doing a    fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like    \" Karma is only justice with out the satisfaction \" are clever .^\n\nAt one point    Caan laments \" Need is the ultimate monkey \" a line so inexplicable he might    as well have said \" love is like hippo ass \" .^\n\nI \'ve  seen porno with better    dialogue .^\n\nAnd some with better plot lines too .^\n\nBut rarely has porn offered    up such a talented cast ( I mean , can you even compare James Caan to Ron    Jeremy ) .^\n\nCaan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind    of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character    depth and weariness .^\n\nBenicio Del Torro is always welcome , though here he    plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation    like the ones the actor gave us in USUAL SUSPECTS and EXCESS BAGGAGE ) ,    adopting  a  Brad Pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy    swaggering .^\n\nSpeaking of Pitt , his ex , Juliette Lewis , is a weak link , either    shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a    silly goose .^\n\nNicky Katt was brilliant in a brief role in THE LIMEY , here his    role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he \'s  only kept around for his    cold presence .^\n\nTaye Diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a    character , though the guy has one helluva death scene .    ^\n\nFor the most part WAY is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo \'s     ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than    simplistic  pawns . ^\n\nIt \'s  vaguely Tarantino-ish , but in a bad TRUTH AND    CONSEQUENCES NM way , with Phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid    rant about \" faggots \" migrating to Los Angeles .^\n\nYou know the routine .^\n\nThe    final shoot out is pure bargain basement John Woo ( who himself seems to be    doing bargain basement John Woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to    be shot at .^\n\nBut those gun shots sure crack like thunder .^\n\nJust the other day    I was watching an old DIRTY HARRY movie on cable and was stunned to hear the    weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from Harry \'s  fetishized Smith    and Wesson .^\n\nOh how far we \'ve  come.

cv485_26879.txt,'When critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like PATCH ADAMS or    more recently PAY IT FORWARD as I am about to do, their opinions are often    greeted with a backlash of angry e-mails, sometimes even mock death threats    from those who (I suppose) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their    entertainment. ^\n\nEven  politicians  (  ! ) tend to dismiss film critics as    heartless  cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while    praising \" filth \" like PULP FICTION .^\n\nThese [ fill in the derogatory term that    you are comfortable with ] tend to forget that a film critic \'s  job is to    review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message    may be .^\n\nThusly PATCH ADAMS is n\'t  a bad film because it \'s  about a doctor who    cares for his patients ; it \'s  a bad film because it \'s  a calculated piece of    brazen audience exploitation .^\n\nSimilarly while PAY IT FORWARD may have its    heart  in  the  right  place ( though I even doubt that , stay tuned , an    explanation is forthcoming ) , it \'s  still an unpleasantly maudlin mess .    ^\n\nThe picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a    somewhat  similarly guarded Kevin Spacey ) , with a burn scared face and    equally  singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible    assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will    change the world .^\n\n12 year old Trevor ( Haley Joel Osmet ) , a Disneyfied do    gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( Helen Hunt ) , comes up with    the notion to PAY IT FORWARD ; this entails a person doing one good deed    ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same    for three others and before long we \'re  all living in a Frank Capra movie .   ^\n\nMeanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( Jay Mohr ) tracks the    \" movement \" which has apparently begun to grow .    ^\n\nPAY  IT FORWARD has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a    smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate    antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core .^\n\nIt \'s  as if director Mimi    Leder  did n\'t   have  the confidence to make PAY IT FORWARD the way she    intended , and compromised out of fear that her film was n\'t  \" gutsy \" enough to    earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for .^\n\nSo the picture adds grit ( a    child molester propositions Trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after    being \" saved \" , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it    seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself    is n\'t  quite sure if it \'s  ready to buy into its own utopian blather .    ^\n\nPAY IT FORWARD offers \" crowd pleasing \" elements for general audiences ; Jay    Mohr \'s  umpteenth variation on the WASPy sleazeball , Angie Dickinson \'s  earthy    alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking \" black hoodlum with a heart of    gold \" ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by Gabriel    Casseus in BEDAZZLED , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty    white liberal clich .^\n\nHurray for Hollywood ) who actually calls the Mohr    character a \" nigga \" and says things like \" can you feel me ? \"^\n\nLeave it to PAY    IT  FORWARD  to  happily include a little minstrel act for our further    enjoyment .^\n\n( Maybe Spike \'s  flick was n\'t  so misguided after all ) .^\n\nThese scenes    feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather    than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you \'ll  find yourself trapped in    should you not heed my warnings .    ^\n\nWhile the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope    this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final    product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting    cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience .^\n\nIt \'s  a picture that looks to    be  tailor  made for Academy consideration , with the main players ( all    previous Oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are    practically variations on their most lauded turns .^\n\nOne scene in which a    slightly de-glamed Helen Hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a    fashion victim [ her look is somewhere between Goth queen and trailer park    mama ] , Hunt \'s  hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates    Spacey , feels right out of her AS GOOD AS IT GETS Oscar clip .^\n\nSpacey , of    course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his    low key AMERICAN BEAUTY performance .^\n\nMaybe the actor should get an award for    coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not ,    even when he \'s  emoting Spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference .    ^\n\nThe usually talented Helen Hunt is the worst offender .^\n\nIn one atrocious    TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL moment Hunt slaps Osmet , immediately covering her mouth    with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on    said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and    I \'m  not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart    in a frenzied search for alcohol .^\n\nThe scene is so hokey it could very nearly    be construed as a parody of hackneyed TV movie blow-ups ; it \'s  all very    theatrical , especially Hunt \'s  performance , which feels like a pathetic plea    to the Academy for another Oscar .^\n\nPAY IT FORWARD has the dubious distinction    of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors should n\'t     get Academy Awards .^\n\nThe picture unknowingly affirms that Oscars transform    nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists .    ^\n\nEven Haley Joel Osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an Academy award    for his unforced performance in SIXTH SENSE , seems more divisive about his    expressions and inflections .^\n\nHis acting has become broader , less intimate ;    it \'s  as if we can make out the little munchkin \'s  thoughts : \" boy this outta    floor em \" .^\n\nNaturally Osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies    children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on    the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual    teacher .^\n\nNever mind that the two could n\'t  be more dissimilar ; his mother is    trailer  trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those Dennis Miller-ey    intellectuals  who  hides  his  insecurities behind a vast vocabulary .   ^\n\nNevertheless  this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair    together in a scene that recalls PARENT TRAP-ish cornball antics .^\n\nBut oh how    we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by    their bootstraps and guide them through life .^\n\nThey \'re  so adorable .^\n\nOf course    the blame ca n\'t  all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of    the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt    of  it should be passed on to Mimi Leder , who directed one of the most    thrilling episodes of ER , then went on to make two awful genre films in a    row .^\n\nThe first being THE PEACEMAKER , a witless post-Cold War George Clooney    vehicle , and DEEP IMPACT , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the    premise of Earth \'s  possible demise by a crazed meteorite .    ^\n\nThe first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clichs , and a complete    absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which    actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with    digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) .^\n\nDEEP IMPACT    has more in common with PAY IT FORWARD ; it \'s  a movie that treats Earth \'s     impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the    havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet    would be a goner within days .^\n\nThe film was full of inspirational speeches    where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make    it appear as if they were being profoundly touching .^\n\nIn PAY IT FORWARD Leder    continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming    almost like a rebuttal : \" See my movie is n\'t  as nave as you might think \" she    seems to be saying .^\n\nNo , it \'s  just horribly confused.

cv487_11058.txt,'Adam Sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy  , The Wedding Singer .   ^\n\nUnfortunately  , that also has the effect of softening his edge .   ^\n\nHe \'s   nowhere near his peak of Happy Gilmore  , not that it was much of one .   ^\n\nHe \'s   certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot .  ^\n\nThe year is 1985  , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia .  ^\n\nAdam Sandler is nice guy Robbie  , the titular wedding singer  , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits .  ^\n\nRobbie \'s   life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee  , Linda ( Angela Featherstone  )  , leaves him at the altar .   ^\n\nHowever  , things are looking up when he meets Julia ( Drew Barrymore  )  , a waitress at the hall .   ^\n\nShe \'s   the perfect woman  , but for one small flaw  :  she \'s   engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king  , Glenn ( Matthew Glave  ) .  ^\n\nSo  , most of the film deals with the slow realization by Robbie that he and Julia are in love  , and his attempts to stop the wedding .  ^\n\nAs far as plots go  , it \'s   a pretty thin and tired one .  ^\n\nTo fill the gaps  , The Wedding Singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia .   ^\n\nFrom Boy George to Michael Jackson  , from Miami Vice to Dallas  , from the first CDs to the last Rubik \'s   Cubes  , this film revels in all the minutiae .   ^\n\nAnd then there \'s   the music   ...  ^\n\nLearning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to Grosse Pointe Blank  , and Romy and Michele \'s   High School Reunion  , this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow .   ^\n\nAs a result  , most songs get maybe a lyric or a half  , but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives  \' eyes  : The Wedding Singer Vols. 2  , 3  , and 4  !  ^\n\nWhile the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring  , at least they distract you from the plot .   ^\n\nAt least last year \'s   My Best Friend \'s   Wedding stirred up the standard  \" keep your true love from marrying someone else  \" plot by making the rival a nice person .   ^\n\nHere  , Glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what Julia saw in him .  ^\n\nBarrymore  , on the other hand  , is simply charming as Julia .   ^\n\nWhich leaves us with Adam Sandler .   ^\n\nHe \'s   at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception  ) .   ^\n\nWhen he \'s   in full nice-guy mode  , he \'s   more pathetic than endearing .  ^\n\nThe film boasts several cameos ( most notably by Steve Buscemi and Jon Lovitz  ) .  ^\n\nBut none of them work well at all .   ^\n\nBuscemi \'s   role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous .   ^\n\nLovitz  , on the other hand  , as a rival wedding singer  , makes you long for his good old days on Saturday Night Live  , where he was actually funny .  ^\n\nThe only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the film \'s   finale ( surprisingly  , one of the only plot-related scenes which actually works .  )  ^\n\nAdam Sandler still has some work to do before he can become a dependable leading man .  ^\n\nWhile he attempts to change his image in The Wedding Singer  , the end result is no net gain .

cv488_21453.txt,'Arriving in a barrage of hype  , The Blair Witch Project is one of the biggest box office success of the year .  ^\n\nHowever  , like The Golden Child  , although Blair Witch has made a lot of money  , it \'s   not very good .  ^\n\nDonahue  , Williams and Leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the Blair Witch myth .  ^\n\nThe film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded  , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles .  ^\n\nAlthough events start of normal  , they get weird pretty quickly  , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on .  ^\n\nAlthough an interesting premise  , The Blair Witch Project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity .  ^\n\nThe biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise .  ^\n\nMost of the dialogue is ad-libbed  , and still manages to sound like a poor B-movie .  ^\n\nThe \' script \' eventually degenerates into shouting matches  , with the F-word included a lot to sound like students .  ^\n\nThere are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur  , but then it \'s   back to the shouting and swearing  , which gets very tiresome very quickly .  ^\n\nIf I wanted to see three people get lost in the woods  , shout a lot and swear  , I \'d   go on scout camp .  ^\n\nBut no  , the audience is meant to  get some entertainment factor out of this  , but I \'m   not quite sure how .  ^\n\nThe supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting  , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes .  ^\n\nWith no music and no budget to work with  , the film has to depend on natural  , psychological scares  , which are sometimes well delivered  , sometimes not .  ^\n\nI never really felt truly scared during any part of the film  , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film .  ^\n\nHowever  , because the actors are so irritating  , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to Heather saying \' What the f*ck is that  ? \' a lot  , and Mike giggling like a loony .  ^\n\nThere \'s   also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things .  ^\n\nThe main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment  , and are hopelessly lost  , Heather still insists on filming it all .  ^\n\nThe film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this  , but it is n\'t   very convincing .  ^\n\nAlso  , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods  , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation .  ^\n\nThere are also some parts where the \' amateur \' camcorder footage is obviously staged  , Heather \'s   apology being a major one .  ^\n\nThe Blair Witch Project  , in the end  , just fails to deliver .  ^\n\nI suppose if you \'ve   been lost camping before  , the film may deliver some chills  , but this is no use for the other 99  \% of the paying audience who have n\'t   been lost in the woods .  ^\n\nApart from the final minutes  , the film is mind boggingly unscary  , and the shouting matches get hideously dull .  ^\n\nThe spook scenes are short and far between  , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide .  ^\n\nAlthough a good idea  , it \'s   not executed well enough to be a fun  , scary cinema experience .  ^\n\nIt \'s   a worrying fact when the website (   ) is better than the film .

cv489_19046.txt,'The U.S. Army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done .   ^\n\nOne particular field manual is known as the FM 22-5  , which among other things  , covers the practice of saluting .   ^\n\nUnder the  \" saluting  \" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer .   ^\n\nThe salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail  , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail .   ^\n\nIn any event  , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman  ) in charge  , rather than by the whole group .   ^\n\nAlmost at the very beginning of THE GENERAL \'S   DAUGHTER  , we see a general \'s   motorcade passing a work detail .   ^\n\nEveryone salutes .   ^\n\nIt looked impressive  , but it just was n\'t   right .   ^\n\nThat little bit showed me that someone either did n\'t   do the appropriate research  , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene .   ^\n\nIn fact  , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture  , as it seems director Simon West tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie .   ^\n\nWhat results is a film that looks good  , but like that one scene  , just is n\'t   right .  ^\n\nThe first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example .   ^\n\nPaul Brenner ( John Travolta  ) is an agent for the Army \'s   Criminal Investigation Division  , undercover at a Georgia Army base to investigate an illegal arms sale .   ^\n\nPrior to the transaction  , the buyer gets a whiff that Brenner is n\'t   the unscrupulous supply sergeant he \'s   supposed to be  , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which Brenner is living .   ^\n\nSo ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK ( we \'ll   just say that it involves propellers  ) .  ^\n\nBrenner then receives new orders when the commanding general \'s   daughter  , Captain Elisabeth Campbell ( Leslie Stefanson  )  , is found naked  , bound  , and dead on one of the base \'s   training ranges .   ^\n\nHe is teamed with rape investigator Sarah Sunhill ( Madeleine Stowe  ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder .   ^\n\nWhat I want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary .   ^\n\nIt gives no insight into Brenner  , other than the fact that he \'s   a little cocky .   ^\n\nDoes the arms subplot turn up later  ?   ^\n\nNo  , so why add this extra running time to the film  ?   ^\n\nThe answer  :  It looked cool .  ^\n\nOr how about the  \" atmosphere  \"  ?   ^\n\nThe beginning of THE GENERAL \'S   DAUGHTER presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees  , dirt roads  , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music .   ^\n\nNice immersion in the setting  , but it soon does n\'t   matter  , for when the film \'s   plot shifts over to the murder investigation  , so does the entire mood .   ^\n\nNo attention is paid to the location of the story  , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme .   ^\n\nDid the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie  ?  ^\n\nInstead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film  , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another  , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside .  ^\n\nThe above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie .   ^\n\nAs I \'ve   already mentioned  , an entire section of the film does n\'t   jibe with the rest  , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty .   ^\n\nBrenner  , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority  , suddenly snaps to in the presence of General Campbell ( James Cromwell  ) and utters some of the corniest  \" yes  , sir\"s I \'ve   ever heard .   ^\n\nHe even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the General \'s   daughter  , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous .  ^\n\nSunhill  , who initially comes across as a professional investigator  , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information  , and even revels in her ingenuity .    ^\n\nBoth characters are protagonists  , but it \'s   hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place  , and in some cases  , simply unappealing .   ^\n\nI could imagine that during filming  , West would shoot a scene  , then take the actors aside and tell them  ,  \" Let \'s   do it again  , but this time  , I want more .  \"   ^\n\nI say this because although Travolta and Stowe are normally very good  , in this film they overact in most of their scenes .   ^\n\nAn even worse offender is Clarence Williams III as the general \'s   aide  , Colonel Fowler .   ^\n\nI swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention .   ^\n\nA far cry from his days as Linc in  \" The Mod Squad  \"  , I ca n\'t   help but think he was acting from West \'s   direction .   ^\n\nA couple of side characters including a West Point psychologist ( John Beasly  ) and a young female private ( Ariyan A. Johnson  ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear .   ^\n\nThe only two actors who seem to have escaped West \'s   influence are James Woods  , who provides a good performance as Colonel Moore  , Elisabeth \'s   mentor at the Psychological Operations unit  , and Timothy Hutton as Colonel Kent of the Military Police .   ^\n\nWoods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people \'s   minds  , and does so without ever taking it over the top .   ^\n\nHutton just kind of hangs around  , but at least he was n\'t   overacting .  ^\n\nI have n\'t   read the Nelson DeMille novel on which this movie was based  , but I \'ll   bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form .   ^\n\nThe movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space  , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished .   ^\n\nEvery time we \'re   presented with some new aspect to the case  , West gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it \'s   the most momentous discovery ever  , but the information is not used by the investigators at all .   ^\n\nInstead  , when conclusions are drawn  , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts  , but lucky guesses instead .   ^\n\nThe Army should have saved time by bringing in Brennan and Sunhill  , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects  , then letting them guess who the killer was .   ^\n\nWould \'ve   been over in a half hour .  ^\n\nThe film finishes with a sort of bookend  , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning .   ^\n\nLiterally during the closing credits  , we get to see Brennan get in his car and drive off  , then we get to see Sunhill get in her car and drive off .   ^\n\nThey both seem kind of happy .   ^\n\nMaybe they were driving away from Simon West .

cv490_18986.txt,'Starring-John Travolta, Madeleine Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton,     MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton: http://welcome.to/movieviews     I don\'t appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking    the plot is interesting, when in fact it\'s ludicrous.^\n\nIn the case of The    General \'s  Daughter , the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a    certain point .^\n\nBut at this juncture in the story , the movie begins to fall    apart like a crumbling cookie .^\n\nThis predictable summer thriller is only    sporadically involving , and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate    for all of it \'s  detailed flaws .    ^\n\nGet past one moment early on where John Travolta exercises his southern    accent , and you \'re  likely to survive this entire movie .^\n\nTravolta plays    Criminal  Investigations Divisions officer Paul Brenner , who \'s  working    undercover at a military base when another situation arises : the apparent    rape and murder of a young female officer ( Leslie Stefanson ) .^\n\nIt turns out    that the victim is the daughter of General Joe Campbell ( James Cromwell ) .   ^\n\nLet the investigation begin .    ^\n\nWith the assistance of fellow CID investigator Sarah Sunhill ( played rather    on-the-sidelines by Madeleine Stowe ) , Brenner uncovers what appears to be an    intricate  and  bizarre  homicide case .^\n\nThings begin to get marginally    engrossing when we meet Colonel Moore ( James Woods ) , a former commanding    officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve .^\n\nWoods submits    another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority , surrounded by    clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar .^\n\nWith echoes of his supporting role    in True Crime , in which he duked it out with Clint Eastwood in enjoyably    profane verbal exchanges , he makes every moment believable .^\n\nHere though , the    intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with Travolta , as the two send    mindful , knowing glares across the room .^\n\nThere are many scenes such as this    in The General \'s  Daughter , in which the veteran cast performs splendidly    under pressure , but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are    difficult to absorb .    ^\n\nDirector Simon West ( Con Air ) , shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish    looking thriller , but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual    part of it .^\n\nThe General \'s  Daughter is , more often than not , a predictable    and unexciting mess .^\n\nIt does not help matters that the plot is virtually    actionless , dragging it \'s  heels all the way at a mind-numbing snails pace .^\n\nA    few brief action scenes , marvelously handled in the editing department , show    that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package .^\n\nFrom a    director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous    stunts ,  I suggest West should stick with mindless , rip-roaring action    features and attempt to avoid future projects like this .    ^\n\nStill , the movie is certainly not without it \'s  merits .^\n\nThe acting is very    good from the majority of the experienced cast .^\n\nThe performances range from    commanding ( Travolta ) to electric ( Woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( Cromwell , who    does n\'t  show off his real talents here ) .^\n\nMadeleine Stowe manages to hold her    own for a while , but as the female lead in an action-thriller , she does n\'t     pull through sufficiently .    ^\n\nOne of the problems with the execution is that it \'s  very predictable. >From    minute one , I had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question .   ^\n\nThe script even unwillingly points him out for us , using familiar techniques    to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end .^\n\nIn all fairness , we \'ve     seen many of the devices used in The General \'s  Daughter put to greater    effect in other films .    ^\n\nThe secrets behind the girl \'s  mysterious death are explained gradually , but    by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels    unnecessary and surprisingly silly .^\n\nThe General \'s  Daughter is not a terrible    movie , and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer \'s  attention span for a    certain period of time .^\n\nBut it just could have been so much better .    ^\n\nMOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton : http://welcome.to/movieviews '

cv494_18689.txt,'You know  , I never really wondered what the Tarzan films would have been like had Tarzan been an old man .   ^\n\nWhile watching Instinct  , I could n\'t   help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies .   ^\n\nEven beside the Tarzan comparison  , Instinct just is n\'t   a very good film .   ^\n\nIt \'s   painfully idealistic  , manipulative  , and silly .   ^\n\nI did n\'t   hate it --    it \'s   simply impossible for me to hate any film starring Anthony Hopkins  ; furthermore  , most of the acting is quite good .   ^\n\nBut I can recognize Instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved .   ^\n\nI can also recognize reasons for wanting to make Instinct  , and it \'s   pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like Patch Adams .    ^\n\nThings start off in the predictable way  , as director Jon Turtletaub introduces us to our hero  , Theo Caulder ( Cuba Gooding  , Jr.  )  , an ambitious  , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced  , old psychiatrist ( Donald Sutherland  ) .   ^\n\nCaulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life  , the one he thinks will make him famous .   ^\n\nThe subject is Ethan Powell ( Hopkins  )  , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in Africa for the past two years .   ^\n\nPowell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in Africa  , and it \'s   now Caulder \'s   job to find out of he \'s   mentally competent enough to stand trial .   ^\n\nThrough a series of short sessions  , Caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of Powell .    ^\n\nEven though it really is an old man version of Tarzan  , much of this central idea is rather interesting .   ^\n\nAs I said  , Hopkins is captivating for every second he \'s   on screen  ; he has a way of convincing us that he \'s   not acting  , that he \'s   actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas .   ^\n\nThe character himself is n\'t   very interesting --   he \'s   just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas --   but Hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action .   ^\n\nGooding Jr. does strong work opposite Hopkins  , playing Caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual .   ^\n\nThe screenplay  , written by Gerald Di Pego and  \" suggested by  \" a novel by Daniel Quinn  , gives us no background information on Caulder  , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he \'s   obsessed with his work  ) .   ^\n\nNonetheless  , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about Instinct .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting .   ^\n\nTurtletaub and Di Pego are both guilty of Instinct \'s   artistic failure  , for they work together to make the dumbest  , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live  , and they do so by means of brainless subplots .   ^\n\nFirst  , we have the prison warden subplot .   ^\n\nThe prison warden is evil and wants to stop Caulder \'s   progress at any cost  ; if this means taking Caulder off the Powell case  , then that \'s   fine .   ^\n\nThere \'s   also the prison guard subplot .   ^\n\nThe prison guard is played by John Ashton  ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision  , and he \'s   instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion .   ^\n\nThen there \'s   the daughter subplot  , in which Maura Tierney ( playing the daughter  ) must look very upset a lot of the time  ; after all  , she is the daughter of a deranged man .  ^\n\nIf some of this stuff sounds familiar  , that \'s   because they \'re   all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films .   ^\n\nThe evil doctor in Patch Adams is not unlike the evil warden here .   ^\n\nThe offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in One Flew Over the Cuckoo \'s   Nest had .   ^\n\nAshton \'s   evil prison guard pales in comparison to Clancy Brown \'s   in The Shawshank Redemption .   ^\n\nHopkins  \' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in The Silence of the Lambs .   ^\n\nAnd then there \'s   the whole Tarzan thing  , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film .      ^\n\nPerhaps what irritates me most about Instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth .   ^\n\nThe message Powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one  :  he thinks that humans are  \" takers  ,  \" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas .   ^\n\nI can sympathize with that  , but only when it \'s   in a compelling film .   ^\n\nThis is the kind of stupid movie --   just like Patch Adams --   in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates  , in this case  ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards .   ^\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas  ?   ^\n\nIf all the subplots of Instinct had been left on the cutting room floor  , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that I watched today .   ^\n\nIf the central idea had been developed beyond the Old Man Tarzan premise  , then we would really have had something interesting --   a movie that does n\'t   rely on the strength of its actors .

Ned Kelly , the    so-called Robin Hood of the Aussies .^\n\nBut he fails to be convincing , in my    opinion he is better suited to play Gene Kelly than Ned Kelly .    ^\n\nThe  film  opens  to  a b/w prologue of Ned Kelly bravely going to his    execution .^\n\nThen it goes to Technicolor and Ned is seen in what goes for    flashback , coming home from jail after a 3-year sentence to see his mom and    reacquaint himself with the large Kelly family .^\n\nThis scene is set in 1871 .   ^\n\nIn the background we hear the booming voice of Waylon Jennings , as he sings    Shel Silverstein \'s  lyrics , which tells --  of Ned \'s  hatred for the British    rule and hope for Ireland to be a republic .^\n\nNed says a debt must be paid  ...    as he hears voices from his dead father , his class-divided country , and his    conscience , all telling him to get revenge .^\n\nSo begins Ned \'s  romp through    Australia \'s  outback , seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have    suffered .    ^\n\nHe begins by stealing horses , after complaining about the unfair tax law on    horses that stray , which favors the rich landowners .^\n\nWhen he \'s  only 20 he    forms a gang , causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police , who    put a price on his head of two thousand pounds .^\n\nWhen Ned \'s  mother ( Clarissa    Kaye ) is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 3-5    years , Ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother \'s  freedom .^\n\nWhen    the authorities refuse , the Kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage , burning    mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers .   ^\n\nRampaging through the outback , they gather sympathy among the poor and lower    classes , who do n\'t  trust the traps ( police ) .    ^\n\nSpoiler to follow in the next paragraph .    ^\n\nIn  the climax , Kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with British    police , but someone Kelly trusted tips the police on the train and Kelly is    trapped in a saloon and captured .^\n\nNed \'s  brothers commit suicide rather than    be taken alive .^\n\nBut Kelly \'s  gang escapes , as Ned heroically has the police    go after only him and his brothers , as they become decoys .    ^\n\nThis was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what    all the fuss was about over Ned Kelly \'s  call for justice .^\n\nJagger did n\'t  have    a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by Ian Jones and Tony    Richardson .^\n\nThe story failed to focus on Australia , seemingly a more British    film than Australian .^\n\nUnder Richardson \'s  lackluster direction , all Jagger    seemed to do , was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge , which soon became    a shrill cry .^\n\nIf you want to see a better film about Ned Kelly , catch \" Mad    Dog Morgan \" ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with Dennis Hopper    giving a much better characterization of Ned Kelly \'s  madness , something this    film could only do in a ho-hum manner .    ^\n\nDennis Schwartz : \" Ozus \' World Movie Reviews \"     ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ '

him to flee for    his life .    ^\n\nAll  well and good , right ?^\n\nWrong .^\n\nApparently , someone decided that the    audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot .   ^\n\n( This is getting to be a popular assumption in Hollywood . )^\n\nSo , the actual    beginning of the movie is not Sewell running for his life , rather , it \'s  a    voice-over  narration by

  ^\n\n( Diedre \'s  therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit    Diedre , alone , in her new apartment --  never realizing , of course , that it \'s     not  her \'s  .^\n\nTherapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these    movies ) .^\n\nHaving successfully snuffed the woman out , Diedre looks at the body    and  says :  \" What was it that you always said to me at the end of each    session , Dr. Jones ?^\n\nOh , that \'s  right. \'I \'m  sorry , but your time is up!\' \"   ^\n\nThis is what passes for humor in the film .^\n\nThe audience does n\'t  necessarily    laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience ca n\'t  believe    they \'re  watching this crap --  although watching it they are ) .^\n\nNick Mancuso \'s     chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that    Butler \'s  character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance    provides for some better comic relief .^\n\nIn between drags off his cigarette ,    for instance , in one of the movie \'s  best scenes , David tries to explain to    his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is .^\n\nIn exaggerated exasperation , he    nearly  shouts \" the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! \"^\n\n( Trust me , it is funny in    context . )    ^\n\nAnd so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion .^\n\nI wo n\'t     reveal  the  ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with    thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film    review ) , but I will say that THE EX has one of the biggest fire hazards    appearing  recently  in film .^\n\nMolly and David own a cabin that becomes    engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds !^\n\nMolly , at one point in    the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering Diedre has moved    into an apartment across from her family \'s  to spy upon them , that \" she \'s     crazy . \"^\n\nYou \'d  be pretty crazy too if you \'d  rented this turkey .^\n\nI \'d  avoid it    unless it \'s  on TV and you come across it .^\n\nIf you do , you may want to watch    it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you    did n\'t  spend money renting it .

cv502_10970.txt,'The Blues Brothers was a wonderful film  , a hilarious comedy packed with good music .   ^\n\nIt cried out for a sequel  , but John Belushi \'s   untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea .   ^\n\nHowever  , eighteen years have passed  , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged .   ^\n\nUnfortunately  , it \'s   a sequel not worthy of the original .  ^\n\nThe film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended .  ^\n\nElwood Blues ( Dan Aykroyd  ) is just getting out of jail  , his brother Jake having recently died .   ^\n\nAs in the first film  , he first visits Mother Mary Stigmata ( Kathleen Freeman  ) and then sets about getting the band back together .  ^\n\nJohn Belushi \'s   absence leaves a terrible hole in the film  , and although three new characters are created to fill the void  , it is still very noticeable .   ^\n\nFirst  , there \'s   Cabel ( Joe Morton  ) the illegitimate son of Elwood \'s   stepfather ( played by Cab Calloway in the first movie  ) .   ^\n\nCabel is reluctant to join his destiny  , and spends most of the movie as an Illinois sheriff  , chasing the Blues Brothers Band .   ^\n\nNext  , there \'s   Mighty Mack ( John Goodman  )  , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band .   ^\n\nFinally  , there \'s   Buster ( J. Evan Bonifant  )  , a ten year old orphan who tags along with Elwood and eventually joins the band .  ^\n\nThe plotting of the film is hardly original  ... it seems to be almost a clone of the original .   ^\n\nElwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band  , they then travel  , while being pursued by the police  , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale .   ^\n\nThe first film had Neo-Nazis as the random element  , this time around  , the Russian Mafia and a militia group fill their role .  ^\n\nIn fact  , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original .  ^\n\nRemember the classic performance at Country Bob \'s   ( where they like both types of music  : Country AND Western  ) from the first movie  ?  ^\n\nWell  , this movie has a performance at a country fair  , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music .   ^\n\nThere \'s   the massive police car pileup  , although this time the gag falls completely flat .  ^\n\nThere \'s   even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of Reverend Cleophus ( James Brown  ) .  ^\n\nThere are plenty of recurring characters too .   ^\n\nIn addition to Mother Stigmata and Reverend Cleophus  , Aretha Franklin reprises her role as Mrs. Murphy .   ^\n\nFrank Oz  , a prison guard in the first film  , makes an appearance here as the prison warden .  ^\n\nAs the stars  , the new Blues Brothers do n\'t   live up to their legacy .  ^\n\nAykroyd is more loquacious  , yet much flatter as Elwood .   ^\n\nJohn Goodman barely has a character as Mighty Mack .   ^\n\nJoe Morton has the deepest character  , but not a terribly interesting one  , as Cab .   ^\n\nAnd what \'s   the deal with the orphan  ?   ^\n\nIt plays like a desperate gimmick that does n\'t   mesh at all with the rest of the film .   ^\n\nAt least Bonifant is n\'t   as precocious as he could have been in the role .  ^\n\nBut the true star  , and the only saving grace  , of the film is the music .  ^\n\nAnd the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits  ) .  ^\n\nAlthough there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original \'s   Rawhide/Stand By Your Man medley  , the music is very much enjoyable .   ^\n\nTo top it off  , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances .   ^\n\nB.B. King  , Blues Traveler  , Eric Clapton  , Travis Tritt  , Wilson Pickett  , Erykah Badu  , Bo Diddley and Steve Winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot .   ^\n\nIf simply copying the original Blues Brothers was n\'t   bad enough  , writers Aykroyd and John Landis dumb it down  , removing any memorable characters  , and replacing them with flashy  , but unbelievable  , magical gimmicks .   ^\n\nIt \'s   a shame .   ^\n\nBuy the soundtrack and avoid the film .  ^\n\nBetter yet  , rewatch the original  ... you \'ll   have a much better time .

cv504_29120.txt,'AMERICAN PIE 2 ( 2001  )  ^\n\nAmerican Pie 2 is filled with laughs .  ^\n\nBut they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater .    ^\n\nI \'m   no prude and I admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy .    ^\n\nBut the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment  , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself .    ^\n\nWhat separates American Pie 2 from its predecessor is heart .  ^\n\nOf the original  , I noted it was  \" a warm  , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up .  \"    ^\n\nWell  , the quartet of chums - Jim ( Jason Biggs  )  , Oz ( Chris Klein  )  , Kevin ( Thomas Ian Nicholas  ) and Finch ( Eddie Kaye Thomas  ) - have grown up .  ^\n\nAt least they are a year older  , but do n\'t   seem any wiser .    ^\n\nFresh from their first year of college the quartet  , along with the obnoxious Stifler ( Seann William Scott  )  , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score .    ^\n\nAs usual nothing goes right until the last reel .  ^\n\nBut what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women .    ^\n\nAnd American Pie 2 is rather degrading to women .  ^\n\nFor the most part  , they are not shown as individuals .  ^\n\nThey are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active  , raging hormones .    ^\n\nIt is telling that the most normal couple  , Oz and Heather ( Mena Suvari  ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she \'s   overseas on an exchange student program .    ^\n\nDespite having been to college  , Jim is still klutzy and awkward  , unsure of himself around the opposite sex .  ^\n\nMost of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him  , including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance .    ^\n\nAlso uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates  , whom the boys suspect of being lesbians .  ^\n\nIt is offensive and plays upon outdated  , adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs .    ^\n\nThe first film  , despite some raunchy moments  , had an innocent charm to it .  ^\n\nThe sequel is more cynical .  ^\n\nIt knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them  : The many mentions of Finch \'s   encounter with Stifler \'s   mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does Eugene Levy \'s   return as Jim \'s   well-meaning  , trying-to-be-hip dad .    ^\n\nThe only performer who is actually given some new  , fresh material is Alyson Hannigan as Michelle  , the band geek from the original .  ^\n\nIn the sequel  , she imbues her character with vulnerability  , wisdom and maturity .    ^\n\nAmerican Pie 2 is a pre-sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office .  ^\n\nIt is a shame  , though  , that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter Adam Herz  , who also penned the original  , could not have set his sights higher .    ^\n\nAmerican Pie 2 is funny  , but it \'s   still a comedown as well as a letdown  .'
cv505_12926.txt,'Well  , what are you going to expect  ?   ^\n\nIt \'s   a movie about a big snake that eats people .   ^\n\nThat \'s   what I should have been thinking when I viewed this film  , because maybe then I would have enjoyed myself more .  ^\n\nInstead  , I ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me  , too .  ^\n\nANACONDA is about a documentary film crew sailing down a South American river .   ^\n\nLed by anthropologists Dr. Steven Cale ( Eric Stolz  ) and Terri Flores ( Jennifer Lopez  )  , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives .   ^\n\nAlong the way  , they find poacher Paul Sarone ( Jon Voight  )  , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda .   ^\n\nTo simply say that this is the world \'s   largest snake would n\'t   be doing it justice  , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide .   ^\n\nIf this is n\'t   a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers  , I do n\'t   know what is .  ^\n\nAt the beginning of ANACONDA  , we find that Flores and Cale have had some kind of relationship in the past  , but that seems to be more or less over now .   ^\n\nI expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line  , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing .   ^\n\nCale chokes on a deadly wasp ( do n\'t   ask me how that happens - I do n\'t   know  ) and is put out of action  , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help .   ^\n\nThis minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot  , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with Sarone \'s   plan to capture the snake .   ^\n\nHowever  , this is negated by the fact that Cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film  , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle .  ^\n\nMost bad characters are either annoying or stupid .   ^\n\nIn this movie  , they \'re   both .   ^\n\nSince this description applies to all the characters except Sarone  , it \'s   hard to find someone to root for .   ^\n\nYou \'re   supposed to back the good guys  , but you really end up cheering for Sarone because he \'s   smarter than everyone else .   ^\n\nOr maybe he \'s   just not as dumb as everyone else .   ^\n\nAt times  , I almost found myself rooting for the snake .  ^\n\nThere are no standout performances here .   ^\n\nEveryone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters .   ^\n\nEven Voight appears to be doing his best impression of Christopher Walken for some reason .  ^\n\nNo matter  , as in most monster movies  , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway .   ^\n\nIn most of the scenes  , the snake is computer generated  , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real .   ^\n\nHowever  , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences .   ^\n\nSometimes  , for example  , the snake just moves too fast .  ^\n\nIt catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall  , for crying out loud .  ^\n\nThen there \'s   another scene where the snake eats one of the characters  , and we see the snake \'s   skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim \'s   pained expression from within the snake \'s   belly .  ^\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous .  ^\n\nA testimony to the film \'s   bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film  , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is .   ^\n\nIn a scene totally unrelated to anything else  , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther .   ^\n\nThe anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard  , one of the panther \'s   eyeballs pops out .   ^\n\nEeeewwwww .   ^\n\nAbove and beyond the sick factor  , however  , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed .   ^\n\nIn films like these  , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained .   ^\n\nIf the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see  , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them .   ^\n\nTo show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters do n\'t   know about  , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown .  ^\n\nIn a case like that  , the showdown just ends up being a letdown .   ^\n\nWhen I saw the snake for the first time  , I decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake I saw was n\'t   the REAL danger .   ^\n\nThis one was just a decoy  , and there was actually a BIGGER snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe .   ^\n\nNo such luck .   ^\n\nOkay  , maybe ANACONDA is actually a decoy  , and there \'s   really a BETTER movie waiting to make its debut .

cv511_10360.txt,'14  years  ago,  National  Lampoon introduced us to a new family - The    Griswolds.^\n\nIn 1983 , the Griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with    the destination of Wally World , a world-renowned theme park in California .   ^\n\nWe laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family    endured .^\n\nTwo years later , we watched again as they went to Europe , and four    years after that , we shared Christmas with them .^\n\nNow , eight more years have    passed , and the laughs have done more than die .^\n\nThey \'ve  been cremated .    ^\n\nVEGAS  VACATION  brings  back  Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold , the good    intentioned but ill-fated father of two .^\n\nThe premise is basically the same .   ^\n\nClark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this    time to Las Vegas .^\n\nHis wife Ellen ( Beverly D\'Angelo ) and teenage kids Rusty    and Audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by Ethan    Embry  and  Marisol Nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find    themselves in Sin City where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety    minutes of slapstick .^\n\nOf course a \" Vacation \" movie would n\'t  be complete    without good ole Eddie ( reprised by Randy Quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing    up at all the wrong times .    ^\n\nThere is n\'t  too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it .^\n\nIt \'s     really just a skit movie .^\n\nThere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie ,    which is not a real term as far as I know .^\n\nThe first would be a movie that    basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two    hour skit .^\n\nThe second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty    shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes .^\n\nVEGAS VACATION comes off    like the first .^\n\nA good example of the latter would be last year \'s  BLACK    SHEEP .^\n\nThe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it    does n\'t  really fit into a movie mold .^\n\nIn these cases , a \" plot \" , which is    generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or    to simply add convenience to the gags ( i.e. Have a good Vegas joke , make a    Vegas movie ) .^\n\nSuch is the case with this movie \'s  mini-plots .^\n\nClark gets    gambling fever and begins spending all of the Griswold \'s  money , Ellen is on    the verge of an affair with Wayne Newton (  ! ) , Rusty has a fake ID and is    using it to his gambling advantage , and Audrey is desperate for fun and    winds up joining her cousin Vickie ( Shae D\'Lyn ) as an exotic dancer .    ^\n\nThe simple fact is : this movie is n\'t  funny .^\n\nAt first , I did find myself    chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got    rolling , my interest suddenly stopped .^\n\nChase plays Clark Griswold really    well .^\n\nHe made the character and he is the character .^\n\nD\'Angelo , to be quite    honest , never was too impressive as Ellen , and this movie does n\'t  show any    signs of redemption .^\n\nAs for the two new Griswold kids , the word \" blah \" comes    to mind .^\n\nThe \" Vacation \" series seems out to prove that anybody can play    these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them .   ^\n\nThey \'re  so generic , you \'ll  expect the credits to read \" Girl #1 as Audrey    Griswold \" .    ^\n\nVEGAS VACATION differs from the first three in the series by more than just    laugh factor .^\n\nYes , it \'s  true that VEGAS VACATION is n\'t  even close to being    close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in    their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this    one  negatively  apart .^\n\nFirst off , why did they leave off the National    Lampoon \'s  heading on the title ?^\n\nI could n\'t  find any reasons why , but maybe    the fact is even National Lampoon did n\'t  want to be associated with such a    lame film .^\n\nThat \'s  saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the    company has proudly presented : LOADED WEAPON 1 , PCU , etc. If they expected    this to be another hit , you would assume they \'d  be proud to tack on the    notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie    sucking , they did n\'t  .    ^\n\nThere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact .^\n\nThe first    three films in the \" Vacation \" series were written by John Hughes , a talented    writer who is behind several popular films of the 80\'s  including MR .^\n\nMOM ,    SIXTEEN CANDLES , THE BREAKFAST CLUB , WEIRD SCIENCE , PRETTY IN PINK , FERRIS    BUELLER \'S  DAY OFF , PLANES , TRAINS , AND AUTOMOBILES , and UNCLE BUCK .^\n\nWowzers !   ^\n\nWhat a rsum !^\n\nLooking at the names , you \'d  think this guy wrote everything    that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980\'s  .^\n\nWell that \'s  not all .^\n\nThis    guy also brought us 90\'s  hits including the HOME ALONE series , the remake of    101 DALMATIANS , DENNIS THE MENACE , and the current FLUBBER .^\n\nVEGAS VACATION ,    however , did n\'t  have John Hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious .    ^\n\nThis time around , the script is in the hands of Elisa Bell , whose only    credits thus far include four made-for-TV movies .^\n\nVEGAS VACATION plays very    much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-TV    sequel .^\n\nIf this sounds like a wild idea , it \'s  not .^\n\nREVENGE OF THE NERDS    third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed    like it .^\n\nVEGAS VACATION would fit in well on the FOX network as a 2:00 a.m.    Sunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it \'s     quite out of place .    ^\n\nStephen Kessler \'s  jejune direction does n\'t  help things either .^\n\nHe only makes    the film even more TV-movie-ish .^\n\nEach consecutive \" Vacation \" movie has    suffered a drop in directing power .^\n\nWe started the series off with Harold    Ramis , who also directed CADDYSHACK and GROUNDHOG DAY as well as co-writing    GHOSTBUSTERS .^\n\nNot too bad .^\n\nThen we had NATIONAL LAMPOON \'S  EUROPEAN VACATION    being directed by Amy Heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits LOOK    WHO \'S  TALKING and CLUELESS , as well as having already directed the infamous    FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH .^\n\nLastly we had NATIONAL LAMPOON \'S  CHRISTMAS    VACATION ,  directed  by Jeremiah S. Chechik , who went on to direct the    charming BENNY & JOON .^\n\nKessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the    short film BIRCH STREET GYM , which received an Oscar nomination in 1992 .   ^\n\nGranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can    allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from    the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal .    ^\n\nIf you loved the \" Vacation \" movies , and I know some of us did , there still    is n\'t  anything here worth seeing .^\n\nIf you loved them , do n\'t  ruin your good    impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala    carte .^\n\nIf you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?

cv514_12173.txt,'I did n\'t   hate The Big Hit  , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film .   ^\n\nFor the entirety of its running time  , my eyes were attached to the screen  , and I never once got bored .   ^\n\nI found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness  :  this is such a confused disaster of a film that it \'s   entertaining to watch it in the same way that it \'s   entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl .    ^\n\nAs a narrative  , The Big Hit is pure garbage  , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries .   ^\n\nIt reminded me a lot of Grosse Pointe Blank  , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways .   ^\n\nIt \'s   fine to mix genres  , if the film makers know what they \'re   doing .   ^\n\nUnfortunately  , writer Ben Ramsey and director Kirk Wong do n\'t   seem to know how to handle the material  , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy .   ^\n\nThe biggest problem with the amalgamation  , in this case  , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place .   ^\n\nBut it sure is a fascinating failure .  ^\n\nMarky . . . er  , Mark Wahlberg stars as Melvin Surley  , a hitman .   ^\n\nHe \'s   a good hitman  , apparently  , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he does n\'t   snipe or make clean kills --  he just kicks the door down and shoots everything  ) .   ^\n\nHe works with a few other hitmen --  Cisco ( Lou Diamond Phillips  )  , Crunch ( Bokeem Woodbine  )  , and Vinnie ( Antonio Sabbato  , Jr.  ) .   ^\n\nThey \'re   a nice bunch of muscular guys  , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex .    ^\n\nThey all work for a man named Paris ( Avery Brooks  )  , who is rich  , powerful  , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen .   ^\n\nIt is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own  ; this  , of course  , is where the plot comes in .   ^\n\nThey decide to kidnap a young Japanese girl named Keiko ( China Chow  )  , who has a rich father .   ^\n\nWhen they do this  , it turns out she is Paris  \' . .  .  ^\n\nGoddaughter  !   ^\n\nIt \'s   very bad to have Paris against you .  ^\n\nThe story is standard action film stuff .   ^\n\nIt \'s   nothing new  , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling  ) .   ^\n\nClearly the major selling point of The Big Hit is that it \'s   a John Woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy .   ^\n\nIt \'s   true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as Face/Off and The Replacement Killers  , which are both far superior  ) .   ^\n\nThere are stunts that are fun to watch  :  the opening sequence has Melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story .   ^\n\nThey use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns .   ^\n\nMelvin is also very good at breakdancing  , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives .  ^\n\nLike I said  , it \'s   not boring  ; most disasters are n\'t   . ^\n\nWhat makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness .   ^\n\nIt seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy  , as Melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains .   ^\n\nThen  , as soon as they go to their first hit  , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere .   ^\n\nThen  , somewhere in between  , it turns back into comedy .   ^\n\nKeiko turns out to be a spunky little girl  ; in one amusing scene  , she is forced to read a letter out loud  , indicating that she has been kidnapped  , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words .   ^\n\nAnd scenes like this work alone  , but Wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious  , or not be in the film at all .   ^\n\nOne of the most irritating moments has Paris ordering Cisco to come up to his office after he learns that Keiko has been kidnapped  ; when Cisco gets there  , Paris and his men are standing around as if they knew Cisco did it  , but they let him out of there  , telling him to find the perpetrator .   ^\n\nThe scene is played for laughs  , but it is n\'t   funny .    ^\n\nAnd since it does n\'t   quite work as a comedy  , it tries to fall back on the action  , which also fails .   ^\n\nThis is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun .   ^\n\nCars land on tree branches and are supported by them .   ^\n\nCharacters betray each other without a second thought .   ^\n\nGrenades are thrown in tight places .   ^\n\nPeople jump out of tall buildings and survive .   ^\n\nPeople outrun tumbling cars  , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds .   ^\n\nMost frustrating of all  , though  , is the film \'s   definition of a hit man  :  these guys are anything but subtle  , quiet  , and skilled individuals .   ^\n\nThey \'re   more like socially depraved militia men ( Melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage  , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns  ) .  ^\n\nThe characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest  ; this obviously does n\'t   make for deep or interesting people to watch .   ^\n\nThe acting is kind of fun  , though --  Wahlberg is a good actor  , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way .   ^\n\nPhillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character  , while Christina Applegate  , who plays Melvin \'s   fiance  , is convincingly air-headed .    ^\n\nThe Big Hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny .   ^\n\nThe funniest parts are supplied by the actors  , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners .   ^\n\nIt \'s   a true disaster  , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional .   ^\n\nDespite all this  , though  , I must reiterate the entertainment value here .   ^\n\nYou can cherish the awfulness of a film like this .   ^\n\nIf you embrace The Big Hit for the catastrophe that it is  , you just might enjoy yourself  .'
cv515_18484.txt,'When the film features Richard Lynch in the role of chief villain  , you know that you can expect nothing more than a B grade action movie .  ^\n\nHowever  , since this film also featured Michael Madsen  , more than capable character actor  , this time in the role of protagonist  , the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt .  ^\n\nHowever  , the very first scenes show clear B grade action credentials - Madsen plays Richard Montana  , tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord Mario Gio ( played by Lynch  ) .  ^\n\nHowever  , the raid was only partially successful  , and Montana is getting the rap .  ^\n\nSo  , he begins his own private war against Gio  , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt .  ^\n\nIn the process  , he meets Gio \'s   mistress Gina Zamora ( played by Rosie Vela  ) and starts relationship with her too .  ^\n\nAlthough it does n\'t   stink like many of the similar films can  , INSIDE EDGE is mostly forgettable B grade action routine .  ^\n\nNobody in this film actually puts much effort  , including Madsen or Lynch  , and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter William Tannen or director Warren Clarke .  ^\n\nThe only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel Rosie Vela  , who  , apart from showing her more than impressive looks  , shows some of the singing talent too .  ^\n\nHowever  , this is n\'t   reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would  , in most likelihood  , forget the next day .

cv517_20616.txt,'You do n\'t   look at a Ren Magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning .  ^\n\nYou likewise do n\'t   look at one for 88 minutes straight .  ^\n\nSurrealist works are notable for their quirks  , and they are fun  , but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting .  ^\n\nThat was my experience with I Woke Up Early the Day I Died  , a surrealistic  , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue .  ^\n\nIt \'s   not a silent movie  ; there is lots of atmospheric music  , occasional screams and weird sound effects  , but nobody ever utters an audible word .  ^\n\nThough the film is distinctive  , its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes  , and as it progressed  , watching became a chore .  ^\n\nThe only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo-legendary Ed Wood  , the man behind such  \" classics  \" as Plan 9 >From Outer Space and Night of the Ghouls .  ^\n\nThe joke  , of course  , is that his films are so bad  , they \'re   good  ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits .  ^\n\nI Woke Up Early the Day I Died  , unfortunatly  , is so bad that it \'s   really bad .  ^\n\nIt stars Billy Zane ( Titanic  ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse  , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around  , stealing a car  , clothes  , and a load of money .  ^\n\nOur thief reaches a cemetery  , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual .  ^\n\nHe falls asleep and finds himself  , literally  , in a hole  , with his money gone .  ^\n\nFor whatever reason  , he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time  , why did n\'t   he just go steal some more  ?  ) .  ^\n\nHe comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they do n\'t   have what he is looking for .  ^\n\nI do n\'t   think either director Aris Iliopulos nor Ed Wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short .  ^\n\nThe subject and the style seem to have been made for it .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length  , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome .  ^\n\nIt grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on  , up to the point where halfway through I was already weary .  ^\n\nIt might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious  ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is .  ^\n\nI Woke Up Early the Day I Died is a comedy  , I guess  , though it could have fooled me .  ^\n\nUnlike most Ed Wood films  , this one tries to be funny and fails  , instead of the other way around .  ^\n\nThere \'s   nothing inherently wrong with that  , in fact  , I think it would only make sense for someone who has been so  \" good  \" at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one .  ^\n\nWhether Wood actually went for comedy in his script we \'ll   never know  , but in either case  , this is a failure .  ^\n\nJonathan Taylor Thomas  , Christina Ricci  , Summer Phoenix  , John Ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos .  ^\n\nRicci  , for example  , plays a prostitute .  ^\n\nHer role consists of dancing around with Zane in his motel room and then being thrown out .  ^\n\nThomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff .  ^\n\nWas the Home Improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work  ?  ^\n\nZane  , meanwhile  , occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up .  ^\n\nLack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature .  ^\n\nThe carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no-budget production .  ^\n\nIt \'s   desperately unfunny  , but thinks it \'s   the funniest thing since Plan 9  ;  , it \'s   so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction .  ^\n\nI hope another film is made from an Ed Wood screenplay for I Woke Up Early the Day I Died is not a fitting send-off  .'

cv521_1730.txt,'Saw an advanced screening of the movie SNIPER last night, and I have to say    I wasn\'t too impressed.    ^\n\nThis film is about an expert marine sniper , played by Tom Berenger , who is    teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to    take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in Panama .^\n\nSound cliche ?   ^\n\nThat \'s  only the beginning .    ^\n\nBilly Zane ( MEMPHIS BELLE ) played the rookie , and never seemed to get a    handle on his character .^\n\nHe was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning ,    you just wanted to smack him .^\n\nThen he goes \" crazy \" from the pressure , but    seems to immediately snap out of it .^\n\nI \'m  not sure if the blame should lie    with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting  ... but it did n\'t  all    come together .    ^\n\nI think Berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part ,    covered  in  camo ,  face painted , stalking through the jungle with his    high-power rifle  ... but once again , his character was given some pretty bad    dialogue , and did n\'t  react too logically to many of the situations .^\n\nThere    was very little logical development in these characters .    ^\n\nMy biggest problem with this film was it \'s  tendency to put these two snipers    in as many inches-from-death situations as possible .^\n\nThey began to resemble    G.  I.  Joes ,  the  Greatest American Hero .^\n\nAnd of course their almost    supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far    too many close calls .^\n\nNow a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold , in    fact that \'s  what made DIE HARD so much fun : the super-hero avenger type .^\n\nSo    some will enjoy the action hero heroics , but I did n\'t  think it fit with the    nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes , and the \" real life \"    feel of covert operations in Panama .    ^\n\nA  word must be said on the camera work , much of it was very nice .^\n\nThe    jungles  of  Panama  ( or  their  stand-ins in this case ) formed a very    picturesque background  ... and the drama of speeding bullets was captured    using  some  nice  trick  photography . ^\n\nMany have seen the slowed down    \" bullet-cam \" following the projectile to its target .^\n\nThis was used well in    the beginning to show the feverish nightmares Berenger gets when remembering    the moment of the kill .^\n\nIt was dramatic when used in flashback ... but it    seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these    shots ( pardon the pun ) into the real time action ... then it just seemed    silly .    ^\n\nAll in all , not a real dog : there is some nice action , good atmosphere , and    pretty photography .^\n\nBut the plot is pretty lame , the acting did n\'t  form a    cohesive whole , and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics .

Harmon and Janet Krajeski  ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of Dr. Sigmoid Colon ( also Jeff B. Harmon  )  , who claims he can cure homosexuality .   ^\n\nIn actuality  , Dr. Colon is homosexual as well and begins his special  \" treatment  \" on Dick Dickson ( unbeknownst to Dick  ) .    ^\n\nWhen April turns down Dick \'s   demand for her to return to Bumfuck  , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the Isle of Lesbos Rambo-style .   ^\n\nInstead of leveling the place he falls in love with Lance ( Alex Boling  ) and the two of them  , along with April and her lover Blatz  , get married .   ^\n\n( Note to the filmmaker  : Why did the character of Lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that I \'m   assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided  ?  )   ^\n\nApril \'s   parents  , feeling like there is no recourse  , call in a favor to President Clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer  ) their way .   ^\n\nThe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the  \" circuitry  \" and they re-wire it and send it back to Washington D.C.  , destroying it .   ^\n\nMr. and Ms. Pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own .   ^\n\nI \'m   not sure if writer/director/co-star Jeff B. Harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs .   ^\n\nEither way  , he manages to present some of the most offensive material I have ever seen in a movie .   ^\n\nThe film opens with a preacher running a small African-American child out of town  , and then later moves on to the hanging of a Michael Jackson impersonator by the Ku Klux Klan ( during a jaunty musical number  )  , preceded by remarks about  \" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others  , such as the Jews  \" .   ^\n\nIf Harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be  , then I apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film  , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that I ca n\'t   help but feel like he had some serious intent .   ^\n\nAs for the entire central theme of the movie  , I \'m   afraid that it \'s   one that I just do n\'t   get .   ^\n\nI tried to keep an open mind while watching it  , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes .   ^\n\nIt was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society .   ^\n\nHow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance  ?   ^\n\nI \'m   not prone to judging anyone and I believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society  , but do n\'t   force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you are n\'t   going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me .   ^\n\nAgain  , maybe I \'m   missing the satirical point that Harmon is trying to make  , but if so  , I think it could have been handled a little more tactfully .    ^\n\nAs far as musical comedies go  , Isle of Lesbos is no Trey Parker and Matt Stone musical  , but a good portion of the songs ARE maddeningly catchy .   ^\n\nDespite the disturbing visuals  ,  \" Mom and Apple Pie  \" stuck with me for the rest of the day .   ^\n\nSpeaking of disturbing visuals  ,  \" Wedding Bells Ai n\'t   Ringing  \" could have been a decent song  , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying .   ^\n\n\" I \'m   a Lesbian  \" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular  ) is also pretty good  , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of Ms. Smith .   ^\n\nIt \'s   mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based .   ^\n\nThe other performers are decent  , save for the Rosie O\'Donnell like performance given by Danica Sheridan .   ^\n\nI have no inherent problem with her character  ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired .   ^\n\nOne particular musical number  ,  \" Lesbian Rock  \"  , was one of the lowest points I have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by Sheridan .    ^\n\nThe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll .   ^\n\nThe remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs (  \" Lesbian Rock  \" included  ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film .   ^\n\nOnce the  \" Isle of Lesbos Reprise  \" was reached  , I felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all .   ^\n\nWhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end  ?    ^\n\nIsle of Lesbos is available on videocassette from www.indie-underground.com .  ^\n\nThe transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent  ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1.85:1 .   ^\n\nIn many respects  , Isle of Lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a Rocky Horror for the new millennium  ) .   ^\n\nThis film is by no means my cup of tea  , but I know there are those out there who will enjoy it .   ^\n\nIf you think it might be for you  , then by all means seek it out .   ^\n\nI  , on the other hand  , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like Gladiator   ...   ^\n\nWait .   ^\n\nAre n\'t   gladiator films considered to be   ... oh  , never mind .

cv525_17930.txt,'One of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself .  ^\n\nSuch was the case with BOXING HELENA  , 1993 directorial debut of Jennifer Chambers Lynch  , daughter of the great David Lynch .  ^\n\nMade in the dying years of post-TWIN PEAKS Lynch craze among movie snobs  , it was hyped as another  ,  \" warped  , twisted masterpiece  \" of Lynch clan .  ^\n\nKim Basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract .  ^\n\nBut  , the result was extremely disappointing film  , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion .  ^\n\nThe movie protagonist is Nick Cavanaugh ( played by Julian Sands  )  , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by Helena ( Sherilyn Fenn  )  , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair .  ^\n\nCavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship .  ^\n\nDuring one of such occasions  , Helena is hit by a car  , and Nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her .  ^\n\nAfter she wakes up  , Helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in Cavanaugh \'s   stylish residence  , but also that Cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping .  ^\n\nShe is still trying to escape  , so Cavanaugh takes off her arms .  ^\n\nApart from casting Sherilyn Fenn ( Audrey Horne in TWIN PEAKS and small cameo in WILD AT HEART  ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies  , this film by Ms. Lynch has n\'t   got anything in common with the works of director \'s   more talented father .  ^\n\nDespite rather bizarre subject  , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light  , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray .  ^\n\nJennifer Lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of Playboy videos .  ^\n\nThe actors are n\'t   good either .  ^\n\nJulian Sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains  ; being neurotic does n\'t   suit him .  ^\n\nBill Paxton was better for this role  , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with Helena \'s   boyfriend .  ^\n\nSherilyn Fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks  , but even the her greater effort in acting could n\'t   help this film .  ^\n\nThe screenplay  , on the other hand  , is awful  , at least for someone who had made best-seller with Laura Palmer \'s   diary - the events in this movie are implausible  , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion .  ^\n\nOne of those subplots involves character of Cavanaugh \'s    \" regular  \" girlfriend  , played by Betsy Clarke .  ^\n\nThe twist at the end  , although unpredictable  , is unbelievable and the viewers  , who had the stomach to endure entire film  , would feel cheated .  ^\n\nAll in all  , BOXING HELENA is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in Kim Basinger \'s   career .

PG-13     Let \'s   get  this  one over with as quickly as possible .^\n\nIf there was a    possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming .^\n\nBut    as it is , \" Godzilla \" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately    most  amateurishly  written film ever released through a major studio .   ^\n\nProducer Dean Devlin and Director Roland Emmerich should be ashamed of    themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch \" Last    Year at Merienbad \" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot .^\n\nNo    amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers    are the 90s equivalent to William Beaudine ( Billy the Kid VS .^\n\nDracula ) .    ^\n\n\" Godzilla \"  opens with stock footage of the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests    interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their    eggs .^\n\nWe are then introduced to the crew of a Japanese fish canning ship ( a    questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be    supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) .^\n\nWell , the ship is attacked    and sunk by an unseen creature .^\n\nLater , a group of Frenchmen led by Philippe    Roache ( Jean Reno ) interview the sole survivor .^\n\nIn a state of shock , the    only thing the man can utter is the word \" Gojira \" ( the Japanese name of the    famed beast ) .    ^\n\nWe are then introduced to Dr. Nick Tatopoulos ( Matthew Broderick , with a    moniker  obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) .^\n\nHe is    currently studying the effects that the Chernobyl disaster has had on the    local earthworm population .^\n\nHe is immediately drafted by the U.S. military    and taken to Panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature .    ^\n\nIn a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna    from the U.S. and Korea for some reason ) is found grounded in Jamaica .^\n\nWell ,    it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for New York .^\n\nWhen    the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of    trucks and makes life hell for the Incumbent Mayor Ebert ( thumbs up for New    York ) .^\n\nThe military , with Dr. Tatopoulos \'s  help , have two tons of fresh fish    dumped in the middle of New York to lure the beast out of its hiding place    in the New York subway system .^\n\nIt finally comes crashing through the city    streets  and has a cute face to face with Dr. Tatopoulos who snaps the    beast \'s  picture .^\n\nThe monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting ,    and the chase is on , with the Army causing 90 \% of the ensuing damage .    ^\n\nWorking from a hunch as to why Godzilla has decided to come to the Big    Apple , Dr.Totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore    that has chosen to remain open ( even though New York has been evacuated ) .   ^\n\nWell the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant .   ^\n\nNeedless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he    must join up with the renegade French Secret Service agents and find the    monster \'s  nesting site and destroy the eggs before the Mayor starts letting    the populous back into the city ( even though the monster is n\'t  dead yet ) .    ^\n\nI sincerely hope that I \'ve  completely spoiled any interest anyone might have    of seeing this film .^\n\nI gave away the relevant plot so that I could spare    those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour \'s  wage on    this tripe .^\n\nEverything about \" Godzilla \" reeks almost as bad as the piles of    rotting fish used to trap the beast .^\n\nThe script ( and let \'s  be clear here ) by    Devlin and Emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be    sure to be the recipient of next years \" Razzie \" award .^\n\nThe dialogue between    Maria Pitillo ( as Audrey Timmonds , Dr. Tatopoulos \' estranged girlfriend ) and    Mr. Broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as    happened during the screening I witnessed ) .^\n\nThe film could be enjoyably    campy if it did n\'t  take itself so damn seriously .^\n\nBut to what end , as there    is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any    reference about Godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind .^\n\nNo.    Godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some French immigrants    and decided to let the state of New York pay for it .    ^\n\nThe film is bleak and ugly looking .^\n\nTaking place at night during a rain    storm , the movie has little or no depth .^\n\nEverything is ugly and dark .^\n\nNew    York has never looked so inhospitable since \" Death Wish \" .^\n\nIn an attempt to    give the film some color , Audrey Timmonds carries a bright red umbrella    which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray    issue .^\n\nThe only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes    on  Jamaica ,  where  Dr.  Tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant    footprint .^\n\nThe scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up .^\n\nYou know from    the outset that Nick is standing in a footprint .^\n\nFor a scientist , this is    very poor observation .^\n\nLet \'s  look at some of the more interesting plot holes    in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the Kevin Bacon    Game ) :     1 . )^\n\nWhy

cv529_10972.txt,'There\'s no reason to doubt that DONNIE BRASCO is based, as its opening    credits proclaim, on a True Story.^\n\nBut if it \'s  an accurate picture of life    on America \'s  mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have    had a much stronger basis in reality than I would have previously thought .   ^\n\nFor from the film \'s  outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing    opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie    lowlifes who recently gave a Madonna song a close reading ) DONNIE BRASCO    resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be    works of fiction .    ^\n\nOur eponymous hero ( Johnny Depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to    be .^\n\nBrasco is Joseph Pistone , an undercover FBI agent who has the task of    chumming-up to Lefty ( Al Pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors Pistone in the    art of being a \" wiseguy \" .^\n\nRegrettably , Pistone learns his lessons all too    well .^\n\nHis concern for Lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son ,    exacerbates  his  own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy    absences and his wife fears that her husband \'s  gangster persona is becoming    a little too convincing .    ^\n\nTrue , the focus on Pistone \'s  family life does deviate from the typical    gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television    drama origins .^\n\nThe unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in    drawn-out domestic squabbles including an ill-advised marriage guidance    routine that slow the film down unnecessarily .^\n\nThe biggest problem with    DONNIE BRASCO  , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the    flair of its many predecessors .^\n\nThe awkward use of an occasional disco tune    momentarily  reminds  us its the 70\'s  , but not with the consistent and    blindingly tacky style I loved those fluoro coloured suits of Scorces \'    costume drama CASINO .^\n\nMore importantly , Pacino \'s  presence triggers memories    of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far    more effectively .^\n\nDONNIE BRASCO \'s  take on American values , for instance , is    feeble and obvious .^\n\nLefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the    accompaniment of grating inspirational music .^\n\nInexplicably , Lefty \'s  Horatio    Alger inspired gush is supposed to move us .^\n\nIt does n\'t  any more than his    family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious    manner as Pistone \'s  .^\n\nJust think a minute on how these themes were explored    in the GODFATHER movies and SCARFACE .^\n\nIn these pictures Pacino \'s  dedication    to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while    his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations    to friends and family was intriguingly dark neither were spared bloody    retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations .^\n\nDONNIE BRASCO \'s  tawdry little    crime , therefore is n\'t  so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes ,    but the shameless way in which it sanitises them .    ^\n\n( Oh  and by the way , I forgot to mention that the script also sports a    startling subplot : Pipstone \'s  superiors are obstructive incompetents who are    infuriated by his constant insubordination is that a \" Damn you McBain ! \"^\n\nI    hear from Springfield way ? )    ^\n\nSo the movie is cliched .^\n\nBig deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ?   ^\n\nWell  you  expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in    abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre .^\n\nDONNIE BRASCO    fails on both counts .^\n\nThe action scenes never rise above the ordinary and    Depp \'s  woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades .   ^\n\nAdmittedly , Pacino does nothing new and Michael Madsen ( Sonny ) simply smirks    his way through the picture like a slightly subdued Mr. White , but both    possess an unmistakable sly charm .^\n\nDepp usually exhibits a bit of class    himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must    have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking    Pacino \'s  well-earned high style .^\n\nThe consequences are painful to watch .^\n\nIts    no exaggeration to say that the film \'s  credibility is seriously strained by    the sight of the Pistone family \'s  uncanny ability to keep a straight face in    front of their breadwinner \'s  phony Brooklyn accent .    ^\n\nPerhaps  we  should take pity on the makers of DONNIE BRASCO  .^\n\nMaybe a    scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and    scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks .^\n\nIf this is indeed    the  case ,  surely the makers of DONNIE BRASCO could have explored the    fascinating possibility that America \'s  underworld is committed to emulating ,    albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes .^\n\nDepp could have    poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is    forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats .^\n\nWho knows what insights into the    criminal psyche could have arisen ?^\n\nBut then again , perhaps Donnie Brasco    is n\'t  so true after all .

cv530_17949.txt,'These days the lack of originality in Hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes .  ^\n\nBut  , only a few years ago  , before Wes Craven publicly made fun of the practice  , sequels had been more popular among Hollywood producers .  ^\n\nSequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south .  ^\n\nThe way to regain popularity and prestige  , they thought  , was the use the same formulas  , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place .  ^\n\nOne of such celebrity was Eddie Murphy  , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade .  ^\n\nIn order to return to the spotlight  , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film  , BEVERLY HILLS COP  , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 .  ^\n\nSeven years later  , for the third instalment  , he used the directorial service of John Landis  , another fading star  , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in TRADING PLACES and COMING TO AMERICA .  ^\n\nThis time  , however  , third time was n\'t   the charm and BEVERLY HILLS III was failure .  ^\n\nEddie Murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback .  ^\n\nEddie Murphy here plays Axel Foley  , fast-talking streetwise Detroit policeman  , who raids illegal chop shop .  ^\n\nThe routine police action ends in tragedy  , when the criminals kill Foley \'s   boss .  ^\n\nDetermined to bring the killers to justice  , Foley realises that their leader is Ellis De Wald ( Timothy Carhart  ) .  ^\n\nWhen it turns out that De Wald happens to be security chief for Wonderland theme park in Los Angeles  , Foley goes back to Los Angeles .  ^\n\nThere  , with the help of his old friend  , local policeman Rosewood ( Judge Rheinhold  )  , Foley would clash with money counterfeit ring .  ^\n\nTen years has passed since the original and times are definitely different .  ^\n\nIn this decade  , the contrast between blue collar Detroit and yuppie Beverly Hills  , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film  , simply does n\'t   work .  ^\n\nScreenwriter Steven E. de Souza provides another conflict  , this time between the childish sillyness of the Good Guys and business-like professionalism of the Bad Guys .  ^\n\nSince Foley belongs to the former  , his character had to watch his language  , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , this film still belongs to action movie genre  , and there is too much violence for little children .  ^\n\nNice example is the humorous scene in the beginning  , which turns into standard Ramboesque bloodbath .  ^\n\nUnlike Donner with the LETHAL WEAPON series  , Landis simply ca n\'t   balance the comedy with  \" regular  \" action  , and the result is a film that fails in both aspects .  ^\n\nAction scenes are sometimes interesting  , but not too spectacular ( at the end  , scenery of Wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself  )  ; humour  , on the other hand  , falls flat .  ^\n\nTo make even worse  , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer  , played by Bronson Pinchot  ) .  ^\n\nIn the end  , although the film provided some entertainment  , viewers  , at least critical ones  , would probably be happy to know that there are n\'t   any plans for BEVERLY HILLS IV .

cv531_26838.txt,'I have never been so confused after watching a movie .  ^\n\n\" Meet Joe Black  \" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year  , with a cinematography  , music and cast that will dazzle most of us .  ^\n\nAt the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season .  ^\n\nAt first you marvel at the elegant direction  , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score .  ^\n\nThen you \'ll   wait for something to happen for half an hour  , but when you finally understand what \'s   going on  , you \'ll   wonder what are actors such as Anthony Hopkins  , Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani are doing in a film like this  ?  ^\n\nThe script is simply a silly and unresolved story  , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture .  ^\n\nIt feels like an eternity .  ^\n\nMost of the time it is a pompous soap opera  , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and   \" meaningful  \" winks .  ^\n\nThe film is based on Alberto Caesella \'s   play  \" Death Takes A Holiday  \" .  ^\n\nThe story concentrates around Bill ( Anthony Hopkins  ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man  , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying  \" yes  \" .  ^\n\nSoon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( Brad Pitt  ) who introduces himself as  \" Death  \" .  ^\n\nIt is Bill \'s   time .  ^\n\nBut Death has other plans .  ^\n\nIt has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive .  ^\n\nOur Bill is chosen to be Death \'s   guide and in exchange he gets time .  ^\n\nBill introduces Death as Joe Black  , who immediately becomes the center of everyone \'s   attention .  ^\n\nBill \'s   business partners speculate about why Joe is constantly at Bill \'s   side  , lives in his house and resides at his office .  ^\n\nThat is not all  , however .  ^\n\nBill \'s   youngest daughter Susan ( Claire Forlani  ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and Joe falls in love with her .  ^\n\nThis relationship is bound to have some serious consequences .  ^\n\nIt would n\'t   be fair to say that this film did n\'t   have some interesting moments  , such as the scene where Joe is invited to join Bill \'s   family for dinner .  ^\n\nWhen Joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love  , the experience is somewhat different .  ^\n\nIt is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure .  ^\n\nIt \'s   one thing to say  :  \" Would n\'t   it be fun to have Death take human form and come down to earth. .  \"  ^\n\nTo create a motion picture out of this is another .  ^\n\nFour screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic .  ^\n\nIt is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film .  ^\n\nOn the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by Martin Brest (  \" Scent of a Woman  \"  ) .  ^\n\nHopkins looks great in any role  , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is  , he will complete it .  ^\n\nHis talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else  , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment .  ^\n\nBut Pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time .  ^\n\nHow can you play Death in human form  ?  ^\n\nTo me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters .  ^\n\nThey are not creatures  , but phenomenas .  ^\n\nSaying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form .  ^\n\nHandling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and Pitt deserves some credit for his work .  ^\n\nSpeaking in a calm  , soft voice  , portraying Death as a lonely  , distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters .  ^\n\nHe looks and acts more like an Angel of Death  , rather than a demon or a red-eyed executioner .  ^\n\nClaire Forlani and others are also fine  , stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits .  ^\n\nUnfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery .  ^\n\nIn other words this is not what I expected from the director of  \" Scent of a Woman  \" .  ^\n\nIt could ( and should  ) be better with such cast and crew .  ^\n\nIn the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera  .'

good foreshadowing for the film .  ^\n\nYou see  , KEEP COOL is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes .   ^\n\nAt least that \'s   the way it seems  , since the camera is constantly moving .   ^\n\nCinema verite is one thing  , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another .   ^\n\nAlthough some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which Chinese youth is slowly growing  , I found it thoroughly distracting  , and after a while  , quite annoying .   ^\n\nHeadache  , as I said .  ^\n\nThe film is about a young bookseller ( Wen Jiang  ) who is after a young woman ( Qu Ying  ) .   ^\n\nThey used to be romantically involved  , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship .   ^\n\nThe first half of the film is about the young man \'s   plan to win her back .   ^\n\nOf course the thing is  , she does n\'t   want to be won back  , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit .   ^\n\nIn the fight  , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker  , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost .   ^\n\nWe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced .   ^\n\nThere is a funny scene ( the only one in the film  ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( Baotian Li  ) in order to recoup his losses .  ^\n\nThere is no sense to be made out of the young woman \'s   behavior  ; cold one minute  , caring the next  , so we feel no sympathy for her character .  ^\n\nThe bookseller would be better off without her .   ^\n\nAlthough the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well  , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner \'s   hand as revenge for the beating he took  , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man .   ^\n\nWhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge  , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation .   ^\n\nHis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with  , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time .   ^\n\nA friendship develops between the two men  , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate .  ^\n\nAlthough only an hour and a half in length  , KEEP COOL contains extraneous material .   ^\n\nThe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out  , since we do n\'t   see her from the midpoint on .   ^\n\nA case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner  , and would have saved us from the bookseller \'s   boring pursuit during the first half .   ^\n\nBut of course  , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour .  ^\n\nThere are a few things that KEEP COOL does right .   ^\n\nAs mentioned before  , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good .   ^\n\nAlthough it grows tiresome  , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic  , and represents the differences in thinking between generations .   ^\n\nIn one scene  , for example  , the bookseller quotes Confucius to get his point across  , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted  , and that it means something entirely different .   ^\n\nAlso effective is the way Zhang sets up tension within a scene  , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner .   ^\n\nThe nightclub owner is counting out money  , slapping each bundle of currency on the table .   ^\n\nWith every shot of his hand  , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge .   ^\n\nUnfortunately  , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film \'s   shortcomings  , and were n\'t   enough to prevent that headache from lingering after I left the theater  .'

Plunkett & MaCleane is a period piece mired down by modern MTV pretentions .   ^\n\nI have nothing against the MTV approach to filmmaking --  used properly it    can save a movie ( see Stigmata ) --  but it ruins this one , making a muddled ,    incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise .^\n\nThere are certain    genres that just do n\'t  go together .^\n\nThe film opens with a sequence that I    still do n\'t  understand .^\n\nIt involves some sort of prison outbreak , a robbery ,    and a gem that keeps being eaten .^\n\nIn any case , the caper ( whatever it may    be ) brings together Plunkett and MaCleane ( Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee    Miller ,  respectively ) , two happy-go-lucky Brits with no way to make a    living . ^\n\nThey  make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to    themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to America .^\n\nTheir    first heist involves a young debutante named Lady Rebecca ( Liv Tyler ) ; a    woman Macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier .^\n\nHis    decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name    \" Gentleman Highwaymen . \"    ^\n\nLady Rebecca also happens to be the niece of the Lord Chief Justice , a    glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career .^\n\nHe demands    that the robbers be caught and punished immediately , leaving the job in the    hands of the devious Chance ( Ken Stott ) who has a few more things on his    mind than catching criminals .^\n\nMeanwhile , Macleane falls in love with Rebecca    infuriating the businesslike Plunkett , who does n\'t  want his plans to be    foiled by his partner \'s  mindless romantic travails .    ^\n\nDirector Jake Scott , son of Ridley Scott ( Alien , Blade Runner ) , has his    father \'s  knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in    actually moving the camera .^\n\nMost of the action scenes are filmed in such a    rapid , jerky way that it \'s  impossible to comprehend what \'s  going on .^\n\nThe    camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying The    Blair  Witch Project due to its lack of fluidity .^\n\nInstead of utilizing    panning  shots  to  impress upon us the scope of the events Scott uses    attention-deficit-disorder edits .^\n\nHe barely ever holds a shot for more than    ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames    between each cut .    ^\n\nThe  weird ,  almost  defiant  lack  of dialogue ( there are no --  NO --     conversations lasting over , say,seconds ) undermines character definition and    our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters .^\n\nThe love    affair  between  MaCleane and Rebecca is no different , emotionless and    unrealistic .^\n\nWhen the script calls for Macleane to decide between going to    America and going to meet his lover , there is no reason for us to believe it    would be worth it for him to abandon his goal ; he and Rebecca barely even    speak to each other throughout the film .    ^\n\nPlunkett  and MaCleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over    substance but since its style , quite frankly , blows , the film has no hope of    succeeding on any level .^\n\nI wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of    its admittedly kinetic pace but I could n\'t  --  it was so kinetic it gave me a    headache .

Kirk ( William Shatner ) , are    present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name .^\n\nNo sooner    is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the    Nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy .^\n\nAmong those rescued from the Nexus is    long-lived alien Dr. Soran ( Malcolm McDowell ) , but he is none-too-pleased at    being back in the real world .^\n\nSeventy-eight years later , Soran is still    trying to get back to the Nexus , and again encounters an Enterprise , this    one led by Captain Jean-Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) .^\n\nSoran \'s  plan involves    destroying a star with an inhabited planet , and the only hope for saving 230    million people is the historic meeting of two Enterprise captains .    ^\n\nI do n\'t  think it is an insult to fans of \" Star Trek \" to suggest that to a    certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important    elements in a \" Trek \" film .^\n\nIt \'s  about a chance to visit with old friends ,    and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered    gravy .^\n\nBut even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be    consistent , and in GENERATIONS that just does n\'t  happen .^\n\nData ( Brent Spiner )    is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing .^\n\nIn the film \'s  major    sub-plot , Data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a    chip he has had in his possession for over a year .^\n\nWhat is his motivation    for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ?^\n\nHe does n\'t  get a joke .   ^\n\nOnce the chip is in place , Spiner gets to have a lot of fun with Data \'s  new    emotions , but the point is that he \'s  no longer the Data we know .^\n\nIf the rest    of the \" Next Generation \" cast fares any better , it \'s  only because they \'re  on    the screen so little that they \'re  simply window dressing .    ^\n\nBut then again , this story is n\'t  really about the new crew .^\n\nIt \'s  about Kirk    and Picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen .^\n\nThe huge    surprise is that William Shatner blows Patrick Stewart away .^\n\nPerhaps because    he knows this is his last go-round in the part that made him a legend ,    Shatner looks like he \'s  having the time of his life ; Stewart , on the other    hand , borders on the deferrential , and is saddled with the same lackluster    motivations as everyone else in the cast .^\n\nStewart \'s  edginess is indicative    of what may be a very bad sign for Paramount \'s  hopes to turn the new cast    into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the    Not Ready for Big Screen Players .^\n\nBy contrast , the prologue which features    Scotty ( James Doohan ) and Chekhov ( Walter Koenig ) is the highlight of the    film .^\n\nThese characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when    they take over the Enterprise in a moment of distress , it \'s  a moment of high    energy .^\n\nOnly thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and    that \'s  time this new crew does n\'t  have .    ^\n\nIt certainly does n\'t  help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted    and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find    your way out again .^\n\nIt \'s  also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who    are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared    nudge of recognition .^\n\nI wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the    \" Trek \" universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by    what is going on .^\n\nAnd what a waste of Malcolm McDowell , who could have been    a  great  monomanical  villain  but should have been given a much more    compelling reason for his obsession .    ^\n\nThere are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at ,    but to do so would be to ignore GENERATIONS \' major flaws .^\n\nHowever , I would    like to make one recommendation : seatbelts .^\n\nNot just for the Enterprise    crew , although you \'d  think by the 24th Century space travel would n\'t  involve    rolling around on the floor during a battle .^\n\nNo , I think the audience might    need them more .^\n\nThis journey is one bumpy ride .

Bears?^\n\nNo , this is n\'t  the lineup for Monday Night Football .   ^\n\nRather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in    \" The  13th  Warrior , \"  a  film  that  is as dramatically flat as it is    gratuitously gory .^\n\nBased on Michael Crichton \'s  book , Eaters of the Dead ,    this Viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled Norsemen and the    glorious battles that they fought .^\n\nTheir strength and honor would eventually    etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up    a sword .^\n\nLuckily for the Vikings , however , their warring abilities were not    as clumsy as this film .    ^\n\nAntonio Bandaras is Ahmed , a travelling ambassador .^\n\nAccompanied by his    friend ( Omar Shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small Viking    village .^\n\nWe see that the Vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest    strength is their fortitude .^\n\nThey laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance ,    and sing songs of battles won .^\n\nBut their festivities are about to be halted    when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is    threatening their land .^\n\nHelp is needed quickly .^\n\nAn elderly , fortune-telling    witch arrives .^\n\nAfter a brief incantation , she proclaims thatwarriors and one    more \" not of Norse blood \" are needed to ensure victory .^\n\nPersonally , I always    wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on    the brink of insanity .^\n\nNonetheless,men eagerly accept their place while    Ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th .^\n\nThe group then sets out to do the greatest    battle of their lives .    ^\n\nOf  course  during their ride , Ahmed becomes the target of fun for the    otherburly Viking warriors .^\n\nBut he ably shows that it \'s  not the size of the    dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog .^\n\nHe is able to    overcome the proud arrogance of the Vikings , but will his skills ( and that    of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ?   ^\n\nIt does not look promising .^\n\nThese creatures , resembling bears , are strong    and  have  high  morale . ^\n\nThey  are  fearless and display a desire for    decapitating the heads of their enemies .^\n\nThey attack by the hundreds and the    next strike will come soon .^\n\nThe warriors prepare their defenses and pray to    their Gods .^\n\nThey are ready to sacrifice their lives .^\n\n\" This is a good way to    die , \" says one of the fallen warriors .    ^\n\nDespite the larger-than-life battle sequences , I was unmoved by the entire    experience .^\n\nAt many points , I was even confused .^\n\nFor example , somewhere in    the middle of the film , a sub-plot creeps up involving the Prince of the    threatened land .^\n\nHe seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater    power during this crisis .^\n\nHowever , the sub-plot never fully materializes ,    and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion .   ^\n\nThere are other questions that I had , but the real problem was that the    story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate .   ^\n\nThe leader of the Viking warriors had the most charisma .^\n\nHowever , Banderas \'s     role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior    makes him so special .^\n\nAn entire rewrite of the Ahmed character is in order .   ^\n\nAlso , much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at    night , which made battles very difficult to follow .^\n\nI would have preferred    more time looking at the Viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their    decision to do battle against the enemy .^\n\nAs it stands , the film manages more    confusion than intensity .^\n\nIt would make Thor cry .

cv544_5301.txt,'One of my favorite songs by the Stranglers includes the lyric  ,  \" You \'d   better watch out for the skin deep .  \"   ^\n\nI \'d   like to extend the same warning  : watch out for SKIN DEEP  , but whatever you do do n\'t   watch SKIN DEEP .       ^\n\nSKIN DEEP is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by Blake Edwards .   ^\n\nJohn Ritter stars as Zach  , a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big-time drinking problem .   ^\n\nI never saw Edwards  \' comedy THE MAN WHO LOVED WOMEN  , but I have to wonder whether SKIN DEEP is a remake .   ^\n\nYou see  , to put it mildly  , Zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets .   ^\n\nAs the movie opens  , Zach \'s   wife  , Alex  , catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress  \' hairdresser .   ^\n\nLike any sensible wife  , Alex kicks Zach out of the house and divorces him .   ^\n\nIn response  , Zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking  , womanizing  , psychotherapy  , and self-discovery .   ^\n\nIf you \'re   turned on by the idea of watching Ritter drink  , get arrested  , have sex  , drink  , crash his Mercedes  , have more sex  , drink  , get arrested again  , drink  , and sing horrendously at the piano  , then SKIN DEEP should be right up your alley .       ^\n\nSKIN DEEP makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters .   ^\n\nZach is a rich  , \' 80s L.A. version of Ritter \'s   Jack Tripper character from  \" Three \'s   Company .  \"   ^\n\nLike Jack  , Zach is clumsy and inept  ; he \'s   the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye .   ^\n\nZach is supposed to be charming and charismatic  , but I failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him .  ^\n\nConsequently  , I never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis .   ^\n\nIn fact  , when Zach crashes his ex-wife \'s   wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying  , I actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony .       ^\n\nTo add insult to injury  , Edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work .   ^\n\nFor instance  , Vincent Gardenia \'s   talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender .   ^\n\nOf all the women in the film --  and there are many --  Alyson Reed  , alone  , stands out as Zach \'s   wife  ; Reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role .       ^\n\nBecause we do n\'t   care the slightest bit about anyone in SKIN DEEP  , the film \'s   few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail .   ^\n\nThe comedy in SKIN DEEP does n\'t   fare much better .   ^\n\nMost of the jokes are dumb  , predictable  , and sitcomish .   ^\n\nAbout every ten minutes  , however  , Edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight-gag  , the most effective of which involves a pair of  \" dueling  \" condoms .   ^\n\nOverall  , the laughs in SKIN DEEP are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat .       ^\n\nMy final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism .   ^\n\nZach \'s   excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life  , but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain .  ^\n\nZach \'s   drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences .   ^\n\nIf he crashes his Mercedes  , he gets a new one .   ^\n\nIf he gets arrested  , his lawyer bails him out of jail .   ^\n\nIf his wife leaves him  , she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he \'ll   clean up his act .   ^\n\nThe tone in SKIN DEEP is all wrong  ; Edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly  , making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter .   ^\n\nPerhaps Edwards should have studied Dudley Moore in ARTHUR or  , better yet  , Michael Keaton in CLEAN AND SOBER before making SKIN DEEP .       ^\n\nIf I were you  , I \'d   heed the advice of the Stranglers  .'

cv559_0057.txt,'This is a film that I was inclined to like at the outset: the two main    characters had been involved with the fine television drama ST. ELSEWHERE    for several years , and I had understood that the director/screenwriter had    written for the show on occasion also .^\n\nI am sorry to report that the results    were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory .^\n\nIf I had to list    a reason why  .... but that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it \'s     not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film .    ^\n\nAdam  Arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and    somewhat  abrasive ,  but a good teacher .^\n\nHe spends his lunches playing    basketball by himself on a nearby court .^\n\nOne day , he meets a drifter ( David    Morse , who plays Jack Morrison on ST .^\n\nELSEWHERE ) in the park , and inveigles    him in a game of one-on-one basketball .^\n\nMorse turns out to be good , and a    friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions    progress on the screen -- Arkin \'s  teaching , and Morse \'s  selling of paper    flowers to passing motorists .^\n\nSo far , my major complaint would be the lack    of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack .^\n\nGood    music to be sure , but it does n\'t  replace the dialogue for setting the mood    or telling the story -- it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique I    rarely admire .    ^\n\nSuddenly their friendship is interrupted by Morse \'s  introduction to a fellow    teacher of Arkin \'s  , a woman Arkin has long admired from afar , but it too    reticent to approach .^\n\nIt appears that she begins to admire Morse ( who enjoys    here attentions , but is n\'t  sure what to do about it -- she does n\'t  realize    that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes    friction between Arkin and almost everyone else .    ^\n\nUntil then , I had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film .^\n\nThe conclusion    is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure .^\n\nThe woman , at    least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; I did n\'t  realize how shallow    until her final scene with Arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying    to make Arkin jealous by her attentions to Morse .^\n\nSomehow , this is made to    appear as if it is Arkin \'s  fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow    victorious that he \'s  gotten such a find of girlfriend .^\n\nFrankly , dropping her    on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action Arkin could make ;    punching  her  in  the  mouth  not the least .^\n\nAfter this , the childish    confrontation between Morse and Arkin at the end seems almost natural .    ^\n\nIf I had to summarize a major gripe , it \'s  that this is a story spread too    thin , that creates semi-likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly    jerks  them  into  being  16-year-olds at the last moment .^\n\nIt might be    true-to-life with some people ; but that does n\'t  mean I have to like it .^\n\nI    do n\'t  .^\n\nGrade : F.

Ludwig, Gheorghe Muresan,    Kathleen Quinlan and Steven Seagal (as himself) Written by David Seltzer    Directed by Michael Lehmann Produced by Castle Rock Entertainment/Columbia    Pictures Corporation [US] and distributed by Columbia Pictures[US]/Sony    Pictures Entertainment [US]     My  Giant  begins  with  a  monologue that\'s more funny than not and a    distinctive `Princess Bride,\' medieval fairy-tale-in-the-90s feel.^\n\nI was    pleasantly  surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes    occurring on a movie set in Romania where talent agent Sammy ( Billy Crystal )    is visiting a client and in the monastery where Sammy ends up after being    mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream .^\n\nAnd    when  Sammy meets Max , his giant , mysterious savior played by Gheorghe    Muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , I loved every    minute of it .^\n\nThe film , of course , plays on the size difference between the    two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects .^\n\nI    particularly enjoyed a shot of Sammy dangling his legs from a Max-sized    chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized    bowls and spoons .^\n\nI also liked Jere Burns \' ( from TV \'s  `Something So Right\' )    performance as the director of the film in Romania .    ^\n\nAt this point , the primary flaw in the film is that Gheorghe Muresan is    incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first    scene .^\n\nIt is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right    out of the gate , as I did understand him more as the film continued and I    became accustomed to his speech .^\n\nHowever , about the time Muresan becomes    coherent , the characters head to New York and the film takes a dive .^\n\nOff the    high board .    ^\n\nSuddenly , we are expected to believe Sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime    ball .^\n\nUp until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but    he did n\'t  come off as a desperate jerk .^\n\nIf he had , the first scenes could    never have been so lighthearted and magical .^\n\nBut now , in New York , we are    further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is    desperate enough to involve Max in a disturbing giant vs. midgets wrestling    match , which I found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of    the film .^\n\nIndeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed    puzzle pieces .^\n\nThis includes the scenes featuring Steven Seagal , when Sammy    gets Max a role in a big , Hollywood movie filming in Las Vegas .^\n\nWhile I    enjoyed seeing Seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist    solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded    it .^\n\nAnd the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that Max    would win the role based on his quotations of Shakespeare .^\n\nAt this point I    found myself thinking , `We \'re  supposed to believe that someone would cast    this guy in a film?\'^\n\nThen I realized he was , and I was watching it .    ^\n\nIn the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to    unbridled sentimentality .^\n\nNote : Major plot points are revealed in this and    the final paragraph .^\n\nMax went to America because Sammy promised to reunited    him with his childhood love , Lillianna , who has n\'t  seen him since he was a    normal-sized kid .^\n\nHer refusal to see Max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an    awkward `ends justify the means \' scene as Sammy \'s  wife Serena , played nicely    by Kathleen Quinlan , poses as Lillianna .^\n\nI found this scene offensive .^\n\nNot    only  did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the    audience , it reduced Max to someone we should pity and coddle , which I    thought was quite undeserved .^\n\nI think Max could have handled the truth ,    gratuitous illness and all .^\n\nLate in the film we learn Max , and in fact all    giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably .^\n\nThis    could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only    to justify Sammy \'s  transformation into a caring , sensitive guy --  and hey , a    great dad and husband , too !     `My Giant\' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped    characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own    internal persuasions .^\n\nA stronger story with more room for character growth    might have been possible if the focus was on Max \'s  struggle to be accepted    and cast in movies instead of Sammy \'s  struggles to get money and become a    better person .^\n\nIn this scenario , Max \'s  illness could have been a integral    part of the film not a story motivator .^\n\nSentiment and emotion would have    followed naturally .^\n\nInstead , we \'re  apparently not supposed to like Sammy    until the end , but we \'re  not allowed to focus on Max .^\n\nCrystal and Muresan    give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `My    Giant\' left me feeling like I \'d  been fed gruel from a giant spoon .

cv566_8967.txt,'Film review (C) 1997 by Kevin Patterson     Batman and Robin (PG-13, 1997) Directed by Joel Schumaker.^\n\nWritten by Akiva    Goldsman .^\n\nStarring Arnold Schwarzenegger , George Clooney , Chris O\'Donnell .    ^\n\nI think maybe it \'s  time for the Batman series to be put to rest .^\n\nNot only    has the first two films \' unsettling insight into what it would really take    for someone to make himself into a \" superhero \" been abandoned , but this one    throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with    few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted    third installment .^\n\nLet me give you an example : In the first scene of the    movie , Batman ( George Clooney ) and Robin ( Chris O\'Donnell ) are summoned to a    museum  that  has  been  literally turned to ice by Mr. Freeze ( Arnold    Schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond .^\n\nMr. Freeze \'s  thugs are    armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our    heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point Robin    manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles    it through the museum .    ^\n\nI might have expected this from an Airplane-style farce , but I do n\'t  think    that \'s  what this movie is supposed to be .^\n\nAfter all , the previous three    Batman  movies  were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the    superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum ,    while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony .   ^\n\nNot any more ; the list goes on and on in this one .^\n\nRobin holds onto the    outside of a flying rocket ship 30,000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing    in the door to save Batman .^\n\nMr. Freeze and Poison Ivy ( Uma Thurman ) leap    from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond .^\n\nA World Dominating    Mad Scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the    old He-Man cartoons .^\n\nMy very favorite example is the scene in which Batgirl    ( Alicia Silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they    come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting    it on fire to distract her .^\n\nNot bad , but would n\'t  the police ( or maybe    Batman ? ) notice if the road was on fire ?^\n\nI knew Gotham City was this crazy    anarchic place , but . . .  .    ^\n\nIt  also seems that the creators of the Batman movies are obeying some    unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in    each successive installment .^\n\nAs if three protagonists and two villains    were n\'t   enough ,  Batman  and Robin further weighs itself down with an    underdeveloped side story of the failing health of Bruce Wayne \'s  butler    Alfred  ( Michael Gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it was n\'t     surrounded  by  so much silliness , as well as several scenes with Elle    MacPherson as Bruce \'s  girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind    us that she is in the movie .    ^\n\nAll  this  might  be  semi-excusable if the story were interesting and    entertaining , but it is n\'t  .^\n\nIn fact , it \'s  kind of boring .^\n\nMr. Freeze and    Poison Ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as Jack    Nicholson \'s   Joker  and  Danny DeVito \'s  Penguin .^\n\nTheir evil plot is as    predictable ( Schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , \" Today Gotham    City , tomorrow the world ! \" ) as it is lame-brained ( did n\'t  it ever occur to    Poison Ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants    too ? ) .^\n\nAnd Robin \'s  constant challenging of Batman mostly just makes him look    bull-headed and stupid and makes us wonder why Batman ever would have taken    him on as a partner in the first place .^\n\nStrip away the stars , the fancy set    design , and the status as a \" Batman movie , \" and all you have here is another    barely passable summer action flick .^\n\nGrade : D+ '
cv567_29420.txt,'In my opinion  , a movie reviewer \'s   most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion .   ^\n\nBut with Soul Survivors  , I \'m   so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous  , uncontrollable rant  , obligations damned .  ^\n\nHowever  , protocol forces me to do otherwise .   ^\n\nSoul Survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends  :  Cassandra ( Melissa Sagemiller  ) is sweet and innocent .   ^\n\nParty girl Annabel ( Eliza Dushku of Bring It On  ) is dating world-weary Harvard student Matt ( Wes Bentley  ) .   ^\n\nMatt still has feelings for Cassie  , who is now dating Sean ( Casey Affleck  ) .  ^\n\nDriving back from a creepy  , gothic party  , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash .   ^\n\nSean dies  , leaving Cassie crestfallen and guilty  , made worse because Sean saw Matt kiss Cassie just minutes after Sean revealed his love for her .  ^\n\nAs Cassie mopes through her classes  , she sees the ghost of Sean all over the place  , urging her to follow him .   ^\n\nAlong with being plagued by other ghastly visions  , Cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party .   ^\n\nAnnabel and Matt try calming her down  , but no one shares Cass \'s   visions .   ^\n\nShe has to figure out this purgatory all by herself .  ^\n\nRarely have I seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material .   ^\n\nIn his directorial debut  , Steve Carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion .   ^\n\nWhen the movie \'s   camerawork is n\'t   pedestrian  , it \'s   clichd . ^\n\nCarpenter \'s   need for close-ups  , his camera following Sagemiller from behind  , drain the movie of any anticipation .   ^\n\nWe already know what to look for  , so why should we be surprised  ?   ^\n\nAnd the sense of scary atmosphere  , which was recently done so well in The Others  , is nowhere to be found here .  ^\n\nCarpenter \'s   script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness .   ^\n\nThis is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character  , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around .   ^\n\nThe second lamest device  , of course  , is the  ,  \" Oh  , it was all a dream  \" resolution .   ^\n\nAnd guess what  ?   ^\n\nThis movie has both  !  ^\n\nNot that the main body of the film  , which has Sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown  , is anything worthwhile .   ^\n\nSince there \'s   no captivating dialogue  , no character chemistry exists anywhere .   ^\n\nThat \'s   a huge problem  , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples .  ^\n\nCarpenter ca n\'t   even get the smutty scenes right  , which are becoming more prevalent in PG-13 movies like Bring It On and Get Over It .   ^\n\n[ The film was recently re-cut from an R rating to get more kids in the seats. -Ed.  ]  When Sagemiller and Dushku dance together at a club  , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some Michael Bay-style quick cuts .   ^\n\nAnd when Sagemiller and Dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint  , they \'re   fully clothed .   ^\n\nRegardless  , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity .   ^\n\nWhy would n\'t   they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine  ?   ^\n\nWhy would they shower in their clothes  ?   ^\n\nWhat if they were n\'t   covered in latex paint  ?  ^\n\nThe cast  , which will see better material in the future  , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes .   ^\n\nI felt sorry for Affleck  , who I \'ve   liked in other movies  , and Bentley  , who was great in American Beauty .   ^\n\nDushku  , who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality  , has got to stop taking roles belonging to Rose McGowan .   ^\n\nAs for Sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned Get Over It  )  , I want to see her in a movie where she plays a person  , and not an object for gawking .   ^\n\nAnd I \'m   not even getting into Luke Wilson \'s   role as a priest .   ^\n\nAt least he \'s   friends with Wes Anderson .  ^\n\nBottom line  : Soul Survivors is so awful I feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it .

cv568_17065.txt,'These are usually reliable filmmakers ( well  , okay  , Crystal  has been in a sizable slump lately  )  , and tellingly  , the first half-hour  of  \" Analyze This  \" was very funny .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , as the running time  ticked away  , I began to think that the first thirty minutes had  ,  unbeknownst to me  , been rewound and were being replayed another  two-and-a-half times .  ^\n\nThe film has obtained a clever premise  , but does  not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more  and more repetitive until I finally stopped enjoying or caring about  what was happening on the screen .  ^\n\nMiddle-aged psychoanalyst Ben Sobel \'s   ( Billy Crystal  ) life is finally  going very well .  ^\n\nAlthough he has never gotten along with his own  uncaring parents  , especially his father  , who is also a psychiatrist  , Ben  has an easy-going teenage son ( Kyle Sabihy  ) and is about to travel down  to Miami to get married to his TV news reporter girlfriend  , Laura ( Lisa  Kudrow  ) .  ^\n\nIn little but a flash  , however  , Ben suddenly sees his plans  ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently  gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy Paul Vitti ( Robert De Niro  )  , who  desperately wants counseling  , even though he himself wo n\'t   even admit to  having anxiety attacks .  ^\n\nBen tries to help Paul  , mostly so he will get  him off his back  , but the plot gets more complicated when Paul follows  Ben to his wedding  , which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his  death .  ^\n\nIt seems to Ben that no matter what he does  , Paul Vitti will not  go away  , and the more they become involved  , the more Ben \'s   potentially  happy life gets into danger .  ^\n\n\" Analyze This  \" has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the  first half  )  , but I always had the nagging thought that what director  Ramis and writers Peter Tolan  , Ramis  , and Kenneth Lonergan had done was  thought of one joke ( Robert De Niro lightly spoofing his serious past  mafia roles  , while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic Billy  Crystal  ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the  106-minute running time .  ^\n\nAdmittedly  , De Niro is very funny here ( and I  ca n\'t   remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe  him  )  , and Crystal is in top-form  , but the whole movie is weighed down  directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them  , including  a substantial plotline .  ^\n\nSince  \" Analyze This  \" bills not one  , not two  , but three writers  , you \'d    think that they would have been able to work together to fix the  noticably large flaws  , but they must have all been on auto-pilot .  ^\n\nOne of  the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way  the movie deals with the supporting characters  , all of which have next  to nothing to do and are n\'t   even given multi-dimensional characters to  attempt to develop .  ^\n\nComing off of her Oscar-caliber work in two of last  year \'s   best films  ,  \" Clockwatchers  \" and  \" The Opposite of Sex  ,  \" Lisa  Kudrow \'s   throwaway  \" girlfriend  \" role is an incredible step down .  ^\n\nSure  ,  Kudrow \'s   fellow  \" Friend  \" Jennifer Aniston did the same thing two weeks  ago in  \" Office Space  ,  \" but at least we got to spend a little time with  Aniston .  ^\n\nKudrow  , meanwhile  , mostly just stands around  , no doubt  wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place .   ^\n\nChazz Palminteri  , as rival gangster Primo  , fares even worse  , in a role  that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character .  ^\n\nFinally  ,  Molly Shannon ( rising film star and cast member on  \" Saturday Night  Live  \"  ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning  as one of Crystal \'s   patients and then completely disappears .  ^\n\nToo bad  ,  considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have  the abilities to support De Niro and Crystal .  ^\n\nOnce  \" Analyze This  \" approached its second wedding scene leaving Kudrow \'s    Laura standing alone at the altar once again  , I had become thoroughly  annoyed by where the story had gone  , and had mostly lost respect for the  character we were supposed to sympathize with the most  , Ben .  ^\n\nAfterwards  ,  the climactic scene with Ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the  depressed Paul  , became a real laugh-free dead-zone  , losing its last  remaining comic punches .  ^\n\n\" Analyze This  \" proves that talent can certainly  help any film out  , but when the written material is n\'t   up to their  level  , what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air .'
cv569_26750.txt,'As we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the Middle East at the moment  , Hollywood does n\'t   lose the oppertunity to get involved  , by telling stories and expressing opinions .  ^\n\nThis film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two Marine colonels  , Hays Hodges ( Tommy Lee Jones  ) and Terry Childers ( Samuel L. Jackson  ) .  ^\n\nThey fought side by side in Vietnam  , where Childers saved Hodges  \' life by shooting an unarmed POW .  ^\n\nThat \'s   against the rules of war but understandable  , in this story anyway  , under the specific circumstances .  ^\n\nCertainly Hodges is not complaining .  ^\n\nYears pass .  ^\n\nHodges  , whose wounds make him unfit for action  , gets a law degree and becomes a Marine lawyer .  ^\n\nChilders  , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould .  ^\n\nBecause of his excellent record  , Childers is sent to Yemen to rescue the American ambassador ( Ben Kingsley  )  , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops .  ^\n\nChilders does what he has to do  : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command .  ^\n\nAfter three Marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire  , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd .  ^\n\nMore than 80 Yemeni men  , women  , and children are mowed down .  ^\n\nChilders is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians .  ^\n\nHe persuades his old friend Hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film .  ^\n\nDid Childers violate authorized U.S. military rules of engagement  ?  ^\n\nOr are there simply no rules in war  ?  ^\n\nThe answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious  , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions .  ^\n\nThe murder of 83  \" innocent civilians  \" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the U.S. Where is the accusations from the Arab leaders  ?  ^\n\nWhere is the U.N.  ?  ^\n\nThe film ends without even telling the most interesting story  : what happens on the international arena  ?  ^\n\nThis film ( in a way akin to films such as  \" A Few Good Men  \"  ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism .  ^\n\nThese accusations are pretty heavy  , but also unfair .  ^\n\nWhat director William Friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking .  ^\n\nOne of the earliest apparent problems with \' Rules of Engagement \' is its lack of credibility .  ^\n\nThe entire operation in Yemen may remind us about what happens in the Middle East right now  , but is overdone  , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed .  ^\n\nA lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality .  ^\n\nThat is precisely why it \'s   not offensive .  ^\n\nIt is completely unobjective .  ^\n\nMany stories are started and never finished .  ^\n\nMany questions are asked  , but never answered .  ^\n\nA lot of parallels are referring to nothing .  ^\n\nIt seems that neither the director  , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film .  ^\n\nIs it about Arab mentality  ?  ^\n\nAmerica \'s   foreign policies  ?  ^\n\nAmerica \'s   role in the world  ?  ^\n\nCorruption in the higher circles  ?  ^\n\nIt goes on and on .  ^\n\nIt consists of countless stories  , but not a definable plot .  ^\n\nIt tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one .  ^\n\nI think that it is ironic  , because director William Friedkin \'s   probably most acclaimed film was  \" The Exorcist  \" which had a silly story  , but became a rather effective film .  ^\n\nIn this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film .  ^\n\nThough several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes  )  , his latest film does simply not engage .  ^\n\nI believe that Friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed .  ^\n\nIt \'s   obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe .  ^\n\nThe characters feel designed  , unreal  , merely shadows  , with no life outside the conflict .  ^\n\nEven the actors can not save this film from going under .  ^\n\nThough both Jackson and Jones act admirably  , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this  , it is not something that these great actors can boast of .  ^\n\nThey have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back .  ^\n\nJackson is gray and Jones uninteresting .  ^\n\nThe rest of the cast  , including Ben Kingsly  , Blair Underwood and Guy Pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks .  ^\n\nThe time has come for the verdict .  ^\n\nOn the charges of complete lack of objectivity  , I find this film guilty .  ^\n\nOn the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking  , I find it guilty .  ^\n\nBut on the charges of racism I find this film not guilty  , because of it \'s   inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere  , not only when concerning the Arab population .  ^\n\nI must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and I do think that screenwriter Stephen Gaghan went a bit too far  , portraying the Yemeni people almost as stereotypical Hollywood bad-guys .  ^\n\nThis is very sad  , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth .  ^\n\nHowever  , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the Muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the United States .  ^\n\nAnd that it \'s   not a coincidence that U.S. residents in the Middle East  , including Yemen are on constant maximum alert  .'

( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy  ?  )  ^\n\nWhat ever happened to the lawsuit  ?  ^\n\nAnd more   ...  ^\n\nAll of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat .  ^\n\nIf the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality  , then that \'s   one thing  , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie  , I wanted some resolution to those pieces as well .  ^\n\nI did n\'t   get it .  ^\n\nThe film \'s   humor also did n\'t   tickle my funny bone either .  ^\n\nThen again  , I \'ve   seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter  , while all I see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen .  ^\n\nSome of these films are also better enjoyed with the added  \" atmosphere  \" of a plant called marijuana  , and I can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements  , in order to jazz up that experience .  ^\n\nBut being sober as I was and expecting a coherent  , funny  , musical with a transsexual twist  , I did n\'t   leave the theater very satisfied .  ^\n\nI came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle  , wrapped in metaphors  , dramatics and more questions than answers .  ^\n\nI will  , on the other hand  , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film  , John Cameron Mitchell  , who is also the man who wrote  , directed and created the play on which this movie is based  , and the tunes  , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs The Sex Pistols  , David Bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene .  ^\n\nNote  : BTW  , it seems as though pretty much every single  \" mainstream  \" critic in the United States loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot  !  )  , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself .  ^\n\nBut having said that  , the main reason that I started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the  \" official  \" critics  , while I  , a regular  \" JoBlo  \" in the audience  , just would n\'t   get what all the fuss was about .  ^\n\nThis movie is a perfect example of why I continue to write movie reviews .

cv572_20053.txt,'MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton: http://Welcome.to/MovieViews     8MM is not going to enlighten your day.^\n\nIt \'s  a dark , grimy and disturbing    portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence .^\n\nNot    only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you \'ll     require a lot of patience as well .    ^\n\nNicolas Cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late .^\n\nHe wore    a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful Snake    Eyes ,  and  here  he attempts a performance that can relate to someone    completely losing their grip on reality .^\n\nCage plays Private Investigator Tom    Welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability .^\n\nAt home , Welles is a family    man , with a wife ( Catherine Keener ) and a small daughter to take care of .   ^\n\nHis  new  assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased    millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her    husband \'s   safe .^\n\nThe film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography    involving  a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally    murdered .^\n\nOr so it seems .    ^\n\nWelles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth .   ^\n\nAnd the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets    in over his head .^\n\nHe hires an adult book store clerk named Max California    ( Joaquin  Phoenix )  to  be  his  guide  through the ugly underworld of    pornography .^\n\nMax knows what Welles is getting himself into , and explains ,    `you dance with the devil , the devil do n\'t  change .^\n\nThe devil changes you.\'   ^\n\nThese turn out to be very wise words .    ^\n\n8MM has a premise that begs for a better execution .^\n\nThe set-up is slick and    well  played , as Cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to    Hollywood  to locate her .^\n\nThis is where everything goes awry .^\n\nAlthough    director Joel Schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque    portrait of the `real world\' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement    to  the formula .^\n\nEverything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless ,    repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects .^\n\nAlthough it    had  enormous potential , the third act of 8MM is a total bust , leaving    intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the    proceedings spiral out of control .    ^\n\nCage  is  the film \'s  sole flame of energy .^\n\nHis performance is actually    believable , but soon the director \'s  demands start to weigh heavily on his    shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation .^\n\nStill , you \'ve  got to    give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for    that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand .    ^\n\nWelles \' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by    Peter Stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the    industry .^\n\nThis is where Cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like    phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent    girl in the film .^\n\nHe tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing    ( Chris Bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight    sequence that would look more at home in a Schwarzenegger movie .^\n\nWritten by    Andrew Kevin Walker , 8MM dissipates into a poor man \'s  Seven , with all the    violence  but  little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a    chilling masterpiece .^\n\nFurthermore , what has become of Joel Schumacher ?^\n\nThe    director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of    dismal flop after flop ( Batman and Robin , anyone ? ) .^\n\nThis putrid thriller is    certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps Schumacher should start    exploring his lighter side .    ^\n\nMOVIE    VIEWS    by   Jamey   Hughton :   http://Welcome.to/MovieViews     ... ... ... ... ... ... .... .

\" 2000\'s  \" Gun Shy \" ) , are rarely ever written as real people , but    merely as one-dimensional caricatures .^\n\nWhen an added layer to one of their    personalities is revealed , it is not to service the character development ,    or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations , but to accommodate    the convoluted plot .    ^\n\nIn a lightweight comedy , you might say , it is not required to have perfectly    realized figures , just as long as they get the job done .^\n\nUnfortunately , for    a comedy to work , it has to at least succeed at being funny , and if there    was a laugh-o-meter available , I \'d  guess that it briefly ascended around  \%    of the time for me .^\n\nSuffice to say , the comedy in \" The Whole Nine Yards \"    works about as well as the broken-down lawnmower in my backyard , and when a    giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes , it is by sheer    luck .    ^\n\nNicholas \" Oz \" Oseransky ( Matthew Perry ) is an amateur dentist living in the    quiet suburbs of Quebec .^\n\nTrapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving    Sophie  ( Rosanna  Arquette ,  delightfully hamming it up with a clearly    artificial French-Canadian accent ) , one day Oz sees that someone is moving    into the house next-door .^\n\nWalking over to greet him , he is horrified to    discover it is Jimmy \" The Tulip \" Tudeski ( Bruce Willis ) , a former contract    killer for the Mafia who has just been released from prison .^\n\nOnce getting to    know him and becoming his friend , Oz is more comfortable with his identity ,    but for Sophie , it means a possible hitman to do away with Oz .    ^\n\nIn her scheme , Sophie sends Oz to Chicago to cash in by informing his old    mob boss ( Kevin Pollak ) about Jimmy \'s  whereabouts , but in the process , he    falls in love with Jimmy \'s  wife , Cynthia ( Natasha Henstridge ) , who is being    held hostage .^\n\nUpon return to Quebec , and with one contrivance after the    next , Oz \'s  dental assistant , Jill ( Amanda Peet ) , is overjoyed to discover    that he lives beside \" The Tulip , \" and forces him to set up a meeting , since    Jill \'s  dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself .    ^\n\nHave you got all that ?^\n\nBecause there is more .^\n\nMuch , much more .^\n\nAnd this is a    movie that , without credits , is little overminutes and feels only like an    hour .^\n\n\" The Whole Nine Yards \" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty-headed    excursion into well-worn terrain already set by far superior pictures .^\n\nHow    the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a    cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might    aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director Lynn \'s  1985    comedy classic , \" Clue : The Movie . \"^\n\nGoing into the theater , preliminary    comparisons  between  the  two  movies  were  unavoidable ,  but by the    twenty-minute mark , when I had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time ,    it was clear this production was in serious trouble .    ^\n\nSince the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the    screenplay , inauspiciously written by Mitchell Kapner , collapses with every    failing \" comedy \" bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of    substance and , frequently , entertainment value .^\n\n\" The Whole Nine Yards \" is    neither  facetious  nor ,  aside from the subplot about Jill \'s  shocking    eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than    not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the    projector , but never igniting any sort of spark .    ^\n\nA few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no    impact at all .^\n\nOn the mediocre side are actually those playing the two    central characters : Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis .^\n\nPerry , innocuously    enjoyable on TV \'s  \" Friends , \" plays the same exact sitcom-style character in    all of his movies ( from 1997\'s  \" Fools Rush In \" to 1999\'s  \" Three to Tango \" ) ,    and  it has become a crushing bore .^\n\nMeanwhile , Willis makes next to no    impression ,  and because of the limited guise of his Jimmy \" The Tulip \"    Tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background .    ^\n\nTheir three female counterparts fare noticeably better .^\n\nBest of all is    Natasha Henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative \" Species \"    movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to Cynthia .^\n\nHenstridge has    the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but    first she must fire her agent .^\n\nAmanda Peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily    straightforward and giddy Jill , and seems to know more about the art of    comedic payoff than even Perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based    solely on comedy .^\n\nIt is too bad , then , that Peet is unnecessarily asked to    disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show    off her breasts .^\n\nFinally , Rosanna Arquette is awful as Sophie , but something    tells  me  that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in    brightening up her limited screen time .^\n\nAlso popping up is Michael Clarke    Duncan , fresh off an Oscar nomination for his role in \" The Green Mile , \" as    Jimmy \'s  largely built friend and fellow killer , Frankie Figs.     When  \" The  Whole Nine Yards \" eventually sputters to its underwhelming    conclusion , one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit .^\n\nA great    deal of movies of this type have been made in the past , and this one is    nothing but a duplication of better films , so what was the point ?^\n\nWithout a    passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments , \" The Whole    Nine Yards \" rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast , and half of the    actors are not charming at all .^\n\nNow , what does that tell you ?

cv586_8048.txt,'This is the worst movie I\'ve seen since the \"so bad I walked out on it\"    \"Jingle All The Way\".^\n\nIt is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven    fueled by crap .^\n\nIt is crap through and through .    ^\n\nNothing works in this film , as to be expected from Joel Schumacher , who has    made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being \" Cousins \" ) .   ^\n\nHere \'s   a man who admits he \'s  a medicore director , a rather charmingly    self-effacing statement .^\n\nBut truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre .    ^\n\nNot all scorn should be heaped on Schumacher though --  Akiva Goldsman should    not be allowed to write ever again .^\n\nThere is no plot anywhere , and the    \" dialogue \" is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring .^\n\nThey set up    Mr. Freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife ,    then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners .   ^\n\nIt  turns  him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his    villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to    bringing his wife from the brink of death .^\n\nBut that \'s  par for course --     nothing  in  this  film  makes  any  sense ,  including  half of Arnold    Schwarzenegger \'s  lines .^\n\nAs Mr. Freeze , Arnold is given way too much dialogue    to spit out at once .^\n\nThis is the same problem he had in \" Jingle All the    Way \" , and it seems that his Austrian accent is getting thicker and more    unintelligible as the days pass .^\n\nPersonally , I think that he has more pull    with the directors and does n\'t  retake scenes to make him understandable .   ^\n\nCompare his dialogue in the Terminator series to the load of nonsense that    streams forth in \" Batman & Robin \" .^\n\nApparently , James Cameron knows how to    get a competent performance out of Arnold .    ^\n\nUma Thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either .^\n\nHer Poison    Ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right .^\n\nAnd her Pamela    Isley scenes are marred by sub-SNL standard \" acting \" , as if she \'s  reading    off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment .^\n\nGiven the \" script \" ,    it \'s  a wonder it did n\'t  happen more frequently .    ^\n\nThere is no redeeming feature in this film --  not George Clooney as Batman ,    Chris O\'Donnell as Robin , nor Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl .^\n\nMichael Gough    is eerily sickly looking as Alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was    prompted  by  his  cadaverous appearance .^\n\nIn fact , there was something    unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished    without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary    about a dying man .^\n\nUnfortunately , every scene about Alfred \'s  sickness is    bungled  with  such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional    resonance --  they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the    scenes were supposed to impart .    ^\n\nThe movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give    any sense of a big battle --  you know there \'s  a bunch of people , but instead    of a melee , Schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist .^\n\nThere \'s  never a    moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem .^\n\nThe only interesting part of the battles    scenes  are  the  freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably    expensive ) .^\n\nEven then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that    they become unwatchable .^\n\nThe hockey team from hell ?^\n\nNot even the TV series    got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that \" Batman &    Robin \" showcases ) .    ^\n\nFrustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off    with nothing to say or do .^\n\nBlink , and you \'ll  miss Elle MacPherson as Julie    Madison , Vivica Fox as a \" why is she even in the film \" vamp in Freeze \'s  lair    ( with all of two lines ) , and Pat Hingle as the most ineffectual Commissioner    Gordan the Batman series ever had .^\n\nAnd in what almost seems like an effort    to save on costs , Vendela Kirsebom has no lines as Mrs. Fries --  she is n\'t     even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me , she \'s  quite attractive    outside of this dreck ) .    ^\n\nAnd as if the film were n\'t  bad enough to limp along with bad direction , bad    dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies    and illogic galore .^\n\nI know it \'s  nit-picky to ask where the hundreds of feet    of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character \'s  arms are n\'t  ripped    out of their sockets when they accomplish a one-armed batarang save after    falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or    where the moisture comes from when Freeze \'s  weapon creates tons if ice .   ^\n\nThat \'s  all traditional comic book stuff .^\n\nBut why does Batman spring a trap    for Freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of    by-standers ? ^\n\nWhy  is there a big switch clearly marked , \" Heat \" in Mr.    Freeze \'s  lair ?^\n\nWhy do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on    Mr. Freeze hand to hand ?^\n\nWhy does Alfred encourage Silverstone to become    Batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ?^\n\nWhy do Batman &    Robin takeminutes to bicker before leaving the Batcave in response to an    emergency ?^\n\nAnd since it established early on that Ivy is using pheromones ,    why do n\'t  they wear masks to filter it out ?^\n\nI could go on and on .    ^\n\n\" Batman & Robin \" is a braindead , pointless , garish , loud film that should    still reign as the \" worst film of the year \" by the time 1998 rolls along .   ^\n\nNote to Warner Bros. --  if you \'re  going to make another Batman film , please    replace Schumacher with nearly anyone .^\n\nBecause it could actually get worse    than this .^\n\nWhat Schumacher does not understand is that \" comic book \" does n\'t     automatically  equal  unbearable idiocy .^\n\nThe true equation seems to be    Schumacher + Batman unbearable idiocy .

cv593_11931.txt,'Back in February at the monthly Los Angeles Comic Book and Science Fiction Convention  , New Line Cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big-screen update of the cult 1960s sci-fi TV show Lost in Space  , complete with in-person appearances by cast members Mimi Rogers  , Matt LeBlanc  , Lacey Chabert  , Jack Johnson  , and even Gary Oldman .   ^\n\nThat should have set off my warning alarms --  the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago  , when none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle   ...  ^\n\nLast Action Hero .   ^\n\nBut no  , like millions of others  , I bought into the hype and  \" got Lost .  \"   ^\n\nIf only I had gotten lost --  literally --  on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbuster wannabe .  ^\n\nYou may find yourself wondering if director Stephen Hopkins and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film .  ^\n\nAt the convention  , Goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series  , and if that really is the case  , I \'d   hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in .   ^\n\nTo say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with --  which there most certainly is not .   ^\n\nAfter the setup  , in which the Robinson family --  father John ( William Hurt  , looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews  )  , mother Maureen ( Rogers  , wasted  )  , daughters Judy ( Heather Graham  , ditto  ) and Penny ( a heavily made-up Chabert  , looking like a junior version of Neve Campbell in Wild Things  )  , and son Will ( young newcomer Johnson  , making the best of it ) --  and pilot Don West ( LeBlanc  , doing a bad Han Solo impression  ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway Dr. Smith ( a watered-down but still-lively Oldman  , cashing a paycheck and loving every minute  )  , the script \'s    \" stream  \" of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along --  and Hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting .   ^\n\nThey encounter another ship .   ^\n\nThey board it .   ^\n\nAlien spiders attack them .   ^\n\nThey return to their ship .   ^\n\nThe other one explodes .   ^\n\nThey land on a deserted planet .   ^\n\nAnd so on .   ^\n\nAn attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act  , but Goldsman does n\'t   seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device  ; when one character \'s   past self dies  , the future incarnation inexplicably lives on .  ^\n\nThe look and effects should be Lost in Space \'s   ace-in-the-hole  , but Hopkins even manages to botch that .   ^\n\nFor a big-budget film  , the visual effects are incredibly shoddy .   ^\n\nIn one composite background shot  , I could see the blue outline around Oldman  ; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like   ... digital effects .   ^\n\nBut nothing in those shots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as Blawp  , a monkey-like space creature that becomes Penny \'s   pet .   ^\n\nEntirely computer-generated and every inch showing it  , Blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a Sony PlayStation game .   ^\n\nApparently Hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it  ; how else can one explain the graininess of Blawp \'s   composite shots with the human actors  ?   ^\n\nBut in doing so  , the seams are that much more obvious .   ^\n\nYou have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of Penny and Blawp is immediately followed by a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of Judy .  ^\n\nNew Line is hoping Lost in Space will become a big franchise much like the long-running Star Trek cash cow at Paramount .   ^\n\nI do n\'t   think so .   ^\n\nIn a few years  , the Lost in Space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question  :  What film ended Titanic \'s   15-week reign at the top of the weekend box office  ?

The plot sees pet detective Ace Ventura retiring after failing to save a    raccoon  ( in a reasonable Cliffhanger spoof ) .^\n\nSoon he is called out of    retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and , if not returned in four    days , will cause two warring African tribes to destroy each other .^\n\nOnce    again , it \'s  up to Ace to save the day , using his uncanny detective skills .    ^\n\nThose who have been disappointed by Carrey \'s  more restrained roles in the    films following the first ACE VENTURA may be glad to see him over-acting to    the best of his ability , but some may be disappointed by the fact that this    sequel does n\'t  capture the feel of the original .    ^\n\nThe original benefited from what looked to be Carrey \'s  constant hyped-up    improv sequences , which were hysterically funny .^\n\nHere , however , the tighter    script  ( which  is reminiscent of the old Disney telemovies ) takes the    improvised material from the first , and shamelessly recycles it in the new    movie , giving Carrey little chance to improvise .^\n\nInstead , his extremely    funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly .    ^\n\nBut one of the biggest problems I had was with the character of Ventura    himself .^\n\nIn the first movie , he was always cool , and one step ahead of every    one else -- perfect for Carrey \'s  off-the-wall approach .^\n\nBut here , Ventura is    made to look a lot stupider , and is often made out as the straight guy -- a    role which is definitely not Carrey \'s  style .    ^\n\nThere are definitely some very funny moments , but they are few and far    between .^\n\nThey are also nowhere near as funny as anything Carrey did in the    first ACE VENTURA , or even DUMB AND DUMBER .

cv597_26744.txt,'For about twenty minutes into MISSION IMPOSSIBLE director John Woo (THE    KILLER, HARD BOILED, FACE OFF) appears to have made an exciting, elegant,    charming spy thriller, kind of a post millennium James Bond adventure with a    strapping American (read: unsophisticated) hero more willing to drop kick    villains than out fox them.^\n\nSadly , as the picture progresses , the final    product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long    episode of MAGYUVER .^\n\nAnd not a particularly good one at that .^\n\nWhat went    wrong ?^\n\nMI2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe    that it \'ll  soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to    more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of    itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein    bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of Tom Cruise \'s  firing gun    just so they can die really cool .    ^\n\nEarly on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers Ethan Hunt ( Tom    Cruise )  and Nyah Nordoff-Hall ( Thandie Newton ) , Woo works some of his    trademark magic .^\n\nIn one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence ,    the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as Cruise and his    stunning opponent stare into one and other \'s  eyes with come hither sexuality    just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so    close to toppling over a neighboring cliff .^\n\nPrior to this we see the famed    trailer opener of Cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then    leaping  from one jagged rock formation to another .^\n\nWhy ?^\n\nI have n\'t  the    foggiest .^\n\nI doubt even John Woo could provide you with a logical reply .^\n\nWith    MI2  Woo  has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that    jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity    defying  effects .^\n\nIt \'s  possible that these \" spies \" could be adrenaline    junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off ,    though of course this is never explored .^\n\nThe scenes I \'ve  described are    really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character .   ^\n\nGod forbid .^\n\nWoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but    they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more    than splices of beer commercial-like visuals .    ^\n\nStill in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish .   ^\n\nCruise and Newton first meet during a vigorous Flamenco dance featuring    several welcome Woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized    movement juxtaposed against the stageromance of two attractive individuals    discovering how attractive the other is ) .^\n\nBetween the frantic dancing , Woo    trains his camera on Cruise and Newton as they make with some sensuous eye    contact .^\n\nThe scene is a little over the top in a Bon Jovi music video circa    1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and Woo casts a    bit of a spell on us .^\n\nSure it \'s  all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that    there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product .   ^\n\nThandie and Cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that \'s  about half as    playfully charming as the Jennifer Lopez\\George Cloony trunk meeting in OUT    OF SIGHT .^\n\nThey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres .^\n\nNewton bats her    eyes flirtatiously .^\n\nCruise grins a little too slyly .    ^\n\nThe Cruise character , Ethan Hunt , has been drastically altered since the    first film .^\n\nHere Cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the    square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 .^\n\nHe \'s  cool and dashing , which    is precisely the kind of role we want to see Cruise in after watching him    sleep walk through EYES WIDE SHUT ( which might just be the longest episode    of RED SHOW DIARIES ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through    MAGNOLIA ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90\'s  ) .^\n\nSadly    as the film progresses we see less of Cruise \'s  initial \" I \'m  the man ! \" charm    and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug .    ^\n\nMI2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act ,    which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just wo n\'t  stop .^\n\nThe    whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun    fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a John Woo film ,    but alas this particular battle could \'ve  been staged by anyone from Renny    Harlin to Joseph Merhi ( of course excepting the \" symbolic \" pigeons who seem    to find their way into every John Woo picture ) .^\n\nWe \'ve  all seen guys slide    across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand .^\n\nIt is n\'t  done    any differently here .    ^\n\nThe action is pure HARD TARGET\\BROKEN ARROW theatrics with nothing to propel    it but the apparent need to see Tom Cruise drop kick face less villains    while his hair whips stylishly in the wind .^\n\nHe \'s  cool for sure but he \'s  made    to be as empty as the movie .^\n\nThe actor is n\'t  used so much for his boyish    appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera    at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one .   ^\n\nWhen he \'s  not beaming away , he \'s  staring into the lens with cold eyes trying    to look mad as hell , but Woo \'s  editing seriously undermines the effort .^\n\nHe    fetishizes Cruise \'s  angular face with such glee that it turns into a NAKED    GUN style spoof .^\n\nI half expected Cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal    that he \'s  really Austin Powers .    ^\n\nIn a classic Woo action moment , Ethan Hunt struts past a fiery doorway    glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death .   ^\n\nThe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission    which  turns  into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle    directly for Cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one    dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting Cruise , basically    inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) .^\n\nThe lead    bad guy ( played by the appropriately British Dougray Scott ) and Cruise face    off in a mentally deficient game of chickenon motorcycles .^\n\nThough instead of    jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly    into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a    hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a    mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a \" so you thought    I was dead  ... \" .^\n\nNot to worry , Cruise takes care of the problem without even    breaking a sweat .^\n\nWhat a hero !    ^\n\nYou may have noticed that I opted not to describe an iota of MI2\'s  plot .^\n\nMy    reasoning is simple : I \'m  not sure of any good it would do .^\n\nThe film itself    has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next    \" special \" effect .^\n\nI was n\'t  kidding when I told a friend of mine that MI2 has    less plot than the average Aerosmith video .^\n\nNobody will go to this for the    plot , and if they do they \'ll  surely regret it .^\n\nAs summer movies evolve ( or    devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly    nothing .^\n\nIn MI , the plot seemed to be built around Brian De Palma \'s  ( that    film \'s  director ) stylistic flourishes , while in MI2 the plot only serves to    give  us  an  intermittent  breather  from Woo \'s  non-stop masturbatory    pandemonium .^\n\nIt \'s  irrelevant in every sense , as is character .^\n\nAll that    ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors.

cv605_12730.txt,'Hunter S. Thompson \'s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , written in 1971 , is already an American classic ; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post-psychedelia of the 1960\'s , but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as \" gonzo \" .^\n\nSoon after the book    was  written ,  Hunter  S. Thomspon became the basis for a character in    Doonesbury known as Uncle Duke .    ^\n\nAnd that is the problem with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas(the movie . )   ^\n\nAlthough the book is one of my favorites , I now agree with Thompson \'s  own    assessment of the novel as \" unfilmable . \"    ^\n\nThe main problem is that the book , although detailing wild drug use and    tripped-out adventures , was not written on the road .^\n\nIt was written and    edited by Hunter S. Thomspons , relatively sober , at his home .^\n\nSo although    the book depicts drug use and still more drug use , it is told with a sense    of aloofness and some humor .^\n\nHunter S. Thomspon , the narrator , while always    drugged  out ,  still  has  a grip on reality , and can still tell , with    journalistic ability , what is going on around him .    ^\n\nNot so with the characters in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas .^\n\nDespite name    changes and one minor scene from the book dropped , the movie is an exact    duplicate of the book , in terms of dialouge .^\n\nUnfortunately , this can get    annoying ,  in  the  form of Johnny Depp\'s(who plays Thompson)excessive    narration .^\n\nAnd the characters , while having vivid personalities , are played    as 2-D characers on the screen : Dr. Raoul Duke(Johnny Depp , the name Raoul    Duke was an alias of Thompson \'s  ) and his riding companion , Dr. Gonzo(Benicio    Del Toro ) , who is a large Samoan lawyer , have no personalities or emotions    at all , save for stoned .    ^\n\nThe film is very faithful to the plot(what there is ) of the book , in that    Dr. Raoul Duke is sent by Sports Illustrated to cover the Mint 400 , and    takes along not only his Samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs .   ^\n\nFrom there , one set of stoned adventures after another happens , including    one of the few good scenes in which Depp , high on acid , watches all the    people in the bar around him turn into , literally , lounge lizards .    ^\n\nWhile the movie has its moments(few ) , it is almost unwatchable at parts ,    especially towards the end .^\n\nDespite a lot of celebrity cameos , the stars    never get off the ground .^\n\nThe set decoration and costumes are great , and    probably deserve an oscar nomination .^\n\nHowever , as we all know , it \'s not sets or effects that make a movie , its the characters ; and quite frankly , these characters are no good .\n'

 ^\n\nHe \'s   perhaps a bit chunky  , but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him ` fatty \'  , which dampens the blow I suppose .  ^\n\nRose McGowan is fully disposable as a sultry WCW cheerleader ( ` The Nirto-est of the Nitro girls  , \' proclaims Gordie  )  , but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers Goldberg  , ` Macho Man \' Randy Savage and Sting ( among others  ) .  ^\n\nWCW fans are sure to appreciate these .  ^\n\nOthers   ... well  , wo n\'t   .^\n\nI found merit in David Arquette \'s   bountiful energy as Gordie  , which brings me to my finishing   .... ahhh   .... ` praise \' for the film  : in ` Ready to Rumble \'  , I have discovered something even more annoying than Arquette \'s   ` AT&T \' television commercials .  ^\n\nNow there \'s   a low blow for you .

cv617_9561.txt,'By the time Dennis Quaid, the ostensible star of SWITCHBACK, makes his first    appearance at about the 22-minute mark, you may find yourself wondering why    he bothered.^\n\nAfter all , writer/director Jeb Stuart has already set up a    fairly promising pair of parallel story lines .^\n\nThe first finds Amarillo ,    Texas sheriff Buck Olmstead ( R. Lee Ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election    battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his    jurisdiction .^\n\nAs Olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men    who come to be our prime suspects .^\n\nLane Dixon ( Jared Leto ) is an enigmatic    young hitchhiker ; Bob Goodall ( Danny Glover ) is the jovial motorist who    offers Lane a ride from Texas to his Utah destination .^\n\nAll the necessary    conflicts seem to be in place --  the internal struggle of Olmstead over the    clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle    as  one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other \'s     protagonist .    ^\n\nBut then Quaid shows up as grimly determined FBI agent Frank LaCrosse .   ^\n\nLaCrosse is certain that the Amarillo murders are the work of a serial    killer he has been tracking for nearly two years .^\n\nHe \'s  not supposed to be    tracking him any more --  according to the Bureau , they \'ve  got their man --     but LaCrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise .^\n\nTwo months    earlier , LaCrosse \'s  own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet    to turn up anywhere .^\n\nLaCrosse knows his killer \'s  work , and he knows that the    man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game .    ^\n\nIt would n\'t  be fair to reduce everything that \'s  wrong with SWITCHBACK to    Quaid \'s  presence , but it \'s  a pretty good place to start .^\n\nThere \'s  a reason    LaCrosse  feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital    center : as a dramatic actor , Dennis Quaid possesses exactly one facial    expression and one vocal intonation .^\n\nWe can tell LaCrosse is determined    because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell    he \'s  grim because every word comes out in an Eastwood-esque rasp .^\n\nA more    flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the    audience into his haunted intensity , making SWITCHBACK _his_ film .^\n\nQuaid    merely  looks  annoyed  and slightly constipated .^\n\nIt \'s  tough to become    emotionally invested in a character \'s  turmoil when it looks like all he    really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes .    ^\n\nEven without Quaid , it does n\'t  appear that SWITCHBACK would have stayed on    course .^\n\nThe early scenes between Leto and Glover have a lively energy ,    building our curiosity over which man --  the taciturn kid or his gregarious    benefactor --  is the real threat .^\n\nUnfortunately , Stuart tips his hand far    too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances    and  the  facts he chooses to reveal .^\n\nOnce the mystery of the killer \'s     identity is dispatched , the interaction between Leto and Glover becomes    stale and predictable .    ^\n\nIn fact , \" stale and predictable \" describes the direction that SWITCHBACK    takes in general , falling back on far-too-common Hollywood devices like cats    jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and    edgy law enforcement agents .^\n\nIt \'s  too bad Stuart was n\'t  willing to spend    more time with Sheriff Olmstead , far and away the most interesting and    appealing character in the film .^\n\nPlayed with atypical restraint by R.

cv619_13677.txt,'Sometimes  , when I decide to write a short story or a poem  , I think of a title first  , and then think of a subject to go with it .   ^\n\nIt seems that the makers of Disturbing Behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence .   ^\n\nI would n\'t   be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits  , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it .   ^\n\nThe title sequence is so good  , so ominous and original  , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began .  ^\n\nOf course  , my attention dwindled shortly into the film .   ^\n\nDisturbing Behavior  , like so many thrillers  , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous .   ^\n\nIt \'s   a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex .   ^\n\nIt \'s   a suspense film with no suspense .   ^\n\nIt \'s   an Evil Small Town story with no story to speak of .   ^\n\nIt \'s   a disaster  , a listless and uninspired disaster  , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences  , a mercifully short running time  , and one terrific set of opening credits .    ^\n\nOur main man is a fellow named Steve Clark  , blandly played by Jimmy Marsden .   ^\n\nHe moves to a small town with his family after  , tragically  , his brother shoots himself .   ^\n\nSteve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother  ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally .   ^\n\nThe big trial for Steve is  , of course  , to fit in at school and make new friends .   ^\n\nMarsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail  , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject .    ^\n\nAs a social reject  , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers  , Gavin ( Nick Stahl  ) and Rachel ( Katie Holmes  ) .   ^\n\nGavin informs Steve that the local group of jocks  , known as the Blue Ribboners  , are actually a bunch of zombies  , assimilating new members into their group  , while sporadically killing innocent people .   ^\n\nSo  , it \'s   up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1  ) solve the mystery  , and 2  ) do something about it .   ^\n\nBy the end of it all  , something has happened and things have been explained  , but the film still does n\'t   make any sense .  ^\n\nDisturbing Behavior was written by Scott Rosenberg .   ^\n\nI \'ve   seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the Armageddon script  )  , and I imagine that  , for the most part  , he knows what he \'s   doing when it comes to screenwriting .   ^\n\nHe did  , however  , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film  , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out .   ^\n\nEvil Small Town films are pretty common ( the last one  , Phantoms  , is also a dismal failure  )  , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work .   ^\n\nRosenberg \'s   script is a complete mess  , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization .   ^\n\nAnd it makes no sense  , nor is their any purpose when things are finally  \" explained .  \"   ^\n\nThere is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks  , but the film never explains exactly what *is* happening .   ^\n\nThey get strapped to chairs  , a microchip is inserted into their eyes  , and --   poof --   they become sex-crazed  , superviolent  , machine-like creatures .   ^\n\nThe doctor responsible for all this  , Dr. Caldicott ( Bruce Greenwood  )  , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or  , perhaps  , this is the only realistic element in the film  ) .  ^\n\nMuch of the writing is simply bad  , and Rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act .   ^\n\nIn one terrible scene  , Gavin explains to Steve all of the high school cliques  , while pointing them out in the cafeteria .   ^\n\nUp front  , I should say that  , in four years of high school  , I did not eat in the cafeteria even once .   ^\n\nThat aside  , the various social groups he points out are general  , uninteresting  , and poorly-shown .   ^\n\nFor instance  , he points to the  \" nerds  ,  \" who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops .   ^\n\nIt \'s   such an obvious cliche that I ca n\'t   believe Rosenberg even bothered .   ^\n\nMost of the dialogue is forced ( no one says  ,  \" Bite me  !  \" anymore  )  , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit .  ^\n\nThis picture is not inspired  , and most scenes flop from one to the other  , with no sense of momentum or energy .   ^\n\nThe blame for this can be placed on director David Nutter  , who apparently likes his films dry .   ^\n\nHorror films should at least exploit violence  , but this one is shockingly timid .   ^\n\nThere are a few good scenes  , though  , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is  , however  , the most forced scene in the film  , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn  ) .   ^\n\nI also liked the school janitor character  , played by William Sadler .   ^\n\nHe has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking .  ^\n\nThe acting is largely a waste of talent .   ^\n\nMarsden is  , as I said  , bland ( thought not particularly bad  ) .   ^\n\nBruce Greenwood is shamelessly wasted .   ^\n\nStahl and Holmes both show they have talent  , but the direction is n\'t   good enough to hone in on their skills ( Stahl \'s   performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads  ) .   ^\n\nNone of these characters expand beyond their one dimension  , and  , frankly  , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just is n\'t   all that cool .    ^\n\nDisturbing Behavior is a wreck of a film  , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began .   ^\n\nI \'m   surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film  , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office .   ^\n\nIt \'s   not boring  , or even blatantly awful  , but it \'s   an uninspired lump of a film .   ^\n\nIt sure starts off nicely  , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable .   ^\n\nSo  , if you go to see this film  , take my advice  :  appreciate the credit sequence  , and pray it never ends  .'

^\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however ,    unlike  Neve  Campbell ,  Hewitt  struggles with acting .^\n\nShe just is n\'t     convincing in this film ( and she was n\'t  in the original either ) .^\n\nThis puts    many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she \'s  very    attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , Valley Girl-type character she tries    to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which    emphasize , exploitatively , her figure .^\n\nAdd to the mix the equally pleasant    yet  irritating  Brandy ,  another rising teen TV star , and you get one    frustrated male audience .    ^\n\nI \'ve  spent so much time on Hewitt and Brandy for a reason .^\n\nI STILL KNOW WHAT    YOU DID LAST SUMMER , though cashing in on the success of the original ,    ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses .^\n\nNothing else    here is original or interesting .^\n\nThis movie , in fact , makes other recent    so-so horror films like URBAN LEGEND and JOHN CARPENTER \'S  VAMPIRES seem like    stunning works of high art .^\n\nI STILL KNOW relies heavily on tired slasher    film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false    alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who    walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and    other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc. You get the picture .   ^\n\nThe entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the    film are going to receive the business end of the killer \'s  hook .^\n\nThey may as    well  have  huge targets painted on them .^\n\nLike SCREAM and its numerous    knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief .   ^\n\nUnfortunately ,  I  STILL  KNOW \'s   characters are n\'t  all that funny .^\n\nIn    particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying    and certainly does n\'t  die soon enough .^\n\nThe death scenes , by the way , are    relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film .^\n\nSeveral of them    are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore    scenes in HELLRAISER : BLOODLINE , a truly sadistic movie .^\n\nThis , too , did not    help the supposed humor I STILL KNOW was shooting for .    ^\n\nAnd what is the deal with the slasher himself ?^\n\nI know that the slasher film    is not a particularly intelligent genre , but Ben Willis has got to go down    as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror .^\n\nCome on , the guy    looks like the Gorton \'s  fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like    a Disney pirate .^\n\nThough his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed    laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror    film , and that \'s  really saying something .    ^\n\nSo , all that \'s  left to talk about here is Jennifer Love Hewitt and Brandy .   ^\n\nBoth prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of    undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene .^\n\nHewitt , however ,    does  do  a  post-shower  scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite. .    .titillating .^\n\nThis scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars    under my rating system .^\n\nOtherwise , Hewitt and Brandy both grate on the    nerves . ^\n\nEarly  in the film , for instance , Brandy wins the trip to the    Bahamas .^\n\nShe and Hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems    like forever .^\n\nI needed extra-strength Tylenol after that part .^\n\nOh , and the    film \'s  conclusion , talk about repetitive !^\n\nPeople who saw I KNOW WHAT YOU DID    LAST SUMMER will predict I STILL KNOW \'s  ending at leastminutes before it    happens .^\n\nBoring !    ^\n\nI  saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater .   ^\n\nAdmission is only one dollar on Wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies    on these days just to ridicule them .^\n\nIt \'s  usually a fun thing to do along    with the rest of the audience , who do n\'t  seem to mind participating in a    mass \" Mystery Science Theater 3000\"-type viewing .^\n\nI STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID    LAST SUMMER , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from    the audience , underscoring how bad it really is .^\n\nIf it were n\'t  for the main    actresses \' revealing wardrobes , I \'d  have had a very , very hard time sitting    through  this lame sequel .^\n\nI ca n\'t  imagine trying to watch it on video    ( horror films seemtimes better in a theater because they rely heavily on    audience participation ) and would n\'t  recommend it to people , unless they \'re     horror film fanatics or huge fans of Hewitt and Brandy .^\n\nI read on a website    somewhere that another sequel is already in the works .^\n\nWhat a depressing    thought .^\n\nHewitt apparently needs to spend more time on TV figuring out how    to act .    ^\n\nRated R , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a    couple  nubile ,  horny  teenagers -- though the sex act itself is always    thwarted .^\n\nI \'d  say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens would n\'t  have a    problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the    film \'s  target audience .

cv622_8583.txt,'To assess Alex Cox \'s  film THE WINNER as a loser would be so indolent .^\n\nIt    would be derisive .^\n\nIt would be glib .^\n\nIt would be dismissive .    ^\n\nRarely  have I seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as THE WINNER , a    would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging .   ^\n\nThe film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful    characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that    nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters    are essentially preposterous .    ^\n\nThe film is set in Las Vegas , and the focus in THE WINNER is on Philip    ( Vincent D\'Onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of    luck ;  he virtually cannot lose at the tables .^\n\nDespite this prodigious    talent , Philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his    gambling  fortunes ,  neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the    foresight to mask his abilities .^\n\nConsequently , he becomes an easy target for    those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent .   ^\n\nLouise ( Rebecca DeMornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into    Philip \'s  life for the purpose of swindling him , while Philip \'s  estranged    brother  ( and , conveniently , Louise \'s  ex-beau ) Johnny ( Michael Madsen )    arrives on the scene .^\n\n( To add some colour , Johnny also happens to be toting    their father \'s  corpse , sans one hand . )^\n\nMeanwhile , Philip is also befriended    by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( Frank Whaley , Billy Bob Thornton , and    Richard Edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new    buddy \'s  gift with the dice .^\n\nSerenely overlooking the chaos from behind the    scenes is the casino owner ( Delroy Lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away    much to reveal that his role in THE WINNER is essentially that alluded to at    the end of the flashy sequence in Martin Scorsese \'s  CASINO which details the    organization hierarchy of a casino \'s  operations - he is the eye in the sky .    ^\n\nIt could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so    oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not    the case in THE WINNER , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not    even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for    Philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of Philip \'s     fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with    entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches THE WINNER    with a complete sense of disinterest .    ^\n\nIt is a shame , as THE WINNER features a talented cast - Mr. D\'Onofrio is an    underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; Mr. Lindo has a remarkable    screen  presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; Mr.    Madsen , Ms. DeMornay , and Mr. Whaley have all done good work in the past .   ^\n\nNone of the actors in THE WINNER are in top form here , and this film wo n\'t     likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes .    ^\n\nDirector Alex Cox does what he can with Wendy Riss \' screenplay , and it is to    his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage    play ; I was startled to learn that THE WINNER was in fact based upon one .   ^\n\nWhile tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be    near-impossible task for Mr. Cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other    director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film \'s  widespread shortcomings    in plot and characterization .^\n\nTo his credit , my understanding is that he has    chosen  to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its    deficiencies .    ^\n\nI caught THE WINNER at its world premiere at the Toronto International Film    Festival in September 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the    film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience    reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the    others I screened .^\n\nTo be honest , though , I could n\'t  begin to isolate what    could be done to this film to improve it - I assume that throwing the whole    thing  out  and  starting  over is out of the question .^\n\nTHE WINNER has    apparently played on cable television in the United States and is beginning    a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing .^\n\nThe film has a    nice upbeat score by Pray For Rain , but I am honestly not being facetious    when I state that the thing I treasured most about my screening of THE    WINNER was the bag of popcorn upon which I was munching. \n'

cv626_7907.txt,'Tina  !  !  !   ^\n\nFetch me the axe  !  !  !  \"   ^\n\nA favourite book of mine called THE GOLDEN TURKEY AWARDS relates the story that when MOMMIE DEAREST was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981  , Paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands .   ^\n\nIt was n\'t   just the film \'s   disappointing box office performance .   ^\n\nIndeed  , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two  , three  , even six times .  ^\n\nNo  , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen Joan Crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year .  ^\n\nIn a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events  , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming  :  \" Mommie Dearest  : The Biggest Mommie Of Them All  !  \" .   ^\n\nExecutives at Paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn  , but it was all too late .   ^\n\nMOMMIE DEAREST was already cementing its place in camp cinema history .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , Faye Dunaway \'s   energetic  , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film \'s   only redeeming feature .  ^\n\nBased on daughter Christina Crawford \'s   trashy biography  , MOMMIE DEAREST chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother .   ^\n\nIf you believe this movie  , it was a life was racked by obsession  , lonliness  , child abuse and rampant egomania .  ^\n\nThe film begins with Crawford adopting two children  , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother \'s   will .   ^\n\nJoan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves  , you see .   ^\n\nBut that \'s   about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film \'s   end .   ^\n\nThe script - laboured over by four writers  , a bad sign in itself  - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum .   ^\n\nFrank Perry \'s   direction is no more than competent  , and Dunaway \'s   bitchy lines aside  , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving .  ^\n\nIn fairness  , the film \'s   second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters .   ^\n\nWhen the adult Christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling  , Joan visits and keeps in touch  , not helping her financially but encouraging Christina \'s   own acting and career ambitions .   ^\n\nCrawford does seem to care about her daughter  , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain .   ^\n\nYou also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers .  ^\n\nAh  , but there IS Dunaway \'s   performance .   ^\n\nAnd what a delicious piece of campery it often is .   ^\n\nHaving just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds  , Crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden .   ^\n\nShe has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she \'s   making .  ^\n\nSpotting a young tree she does n\'t   like the look of  , she turns to the trembling Christina and utters the immortal line  \" Tina  !  !   ^\n\nFetch me the axe  !  !  \" with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling .  ^\n\nIn the film \'s   most outrageous scene  , Joan realises that some of her daughter \'s   clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers .   ^\n\nOh dear  !   ^\n\nSounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum  , does n\'t   it  ?    ^\n\nThis time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst  :  \" No  ... wire  ... hangers  ... .^\n\nEVER  !  !  !  !  \" .   ^\n\nAnd later  , when the Board of her late husband \'s   company Pepsi Cola tries to divest her of her directorship  , she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring  :  \" Do n\'t   fuck with me  , fellas  !  !  \" .   ^\n\nOh joy  !  ^\n\nSomething of a camp classic  , then  , but if that \'s   not you \'re   cup of tea then MOMMIE DEAREST does n\'t   have too much to recommend it .   ^\n\nBetter you see the real Crawford in THE WOMEN ( 1939  )  , MILDRED PIERCE ( 1945  ) or WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE ( 1962  ) .   ^\n\nGreat films distinguished by great performances  , and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than Frank Perry \'s   shrieking piece of tabloid froth  .'

cv639_10797.txt,'I \'ll   be the first to admit it .   ^\n\nWhen you mention the book Great Expectations  , I immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high English class  , where I was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as Pip and Magwitch .  ^\n\nYes  , it \'s   a classic of literature  , but it was a rather dry one  , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine .  ^\n\nCertainly  , the experience was n\'t   truly that bad  , but  , to quote Ethan Hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book  ,  \" I \'m   not going to tell the story the way it happened  ...^\n\nI \'ll   gonna tell it the way I remember it .  \"  ^\n\nAnyway  , to return from nostalgia lane  , and get back to the present  , Hollywood  , in it \'s   trendy attempt to modernize the classics  , now presents an updated film version of Great Expectations .  ^\n\nInstead of Pip  , this time the central character is named Finn ( played as a boy by Jeremy Kissner  , and by Ethan Hawke as an adult  ) .   ^\n\nFinn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister Maggie  , or should that be Mrs. Joe  , ( Kim Dickens  )  , and her boorish fisherman husband  , Joe ( Chris Cooper  ) .   ^\n\nThe setting is the Florida coast during the mid-70s .   ^\n\nFinn is a blooming artist  , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects  ) .  ^\n\nDuring one of these escapades  , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( Robert DeNiro  ) .  ^\n\nBorrowing a page from the superhuman Max Cady  , DeNiro \'s   criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity  , and favors hiding on the ocean floor .   ^\n\nOK  ... maybe that \'s   an exaggeration  , but he certainly beats any of Houdini \'s   records in the opening scenes of the film .   ^\n\nAnd that \'s   nothing next to the fuel efficiency of Finn \'s   motorboat  , but I digress .   ^\n\nAnyway  , Finn does the convict a good deed  , just to show that he \'s   a really swell guy .  ^\n\nAnd then the plot moves on .  ^\n\nEnter Miss Havisham  ... or Ms. Dinsmoor here ( Anne Bancroft  ) .   ^\n\nAbandoned at the altar some 26 years ago  , Ms. Dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid .  ^\n\nWith bizarre clothing  , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup  , Anne Bancroft seriously overacts in this role .  ^\n\nAlthough she ends up nowhere near a believable character  , she does add some humor to the film .  ^\n\nJoe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner  , but the insane Ms. Dinsmoor soon hires Finn to be a plaything for her niece  , Estella ( Raquel Beaudene as a young girl  , Gwyneth Paltrow as an adult  ) .  ^\n\nFor no apparent reason  , other than to provide the main plot of the film  , Finn is instantly stricken for the Estella .   ^\n\nPerhaps it \'s   her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person  , or maybe Finn has simply never met a girl before .  ^\n\nIn any case  , neither as children nor adults  , chemistry simply does n\'t   exist between the two  , and yet Finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her .  ^\n\nEven when  , as an adult  , Finn arrives in New York at the behest of a mysterious benefactor  , reacquaints himself with Estella  , and draws her portrait in the nude  , there \'s   nothing .   ^\n\nIn fact  , there is more sexual tension between Helen Hunt and  Greg Kinnear \'s   gay artist during a similar scene in As Good As It Gets .  ^\n\nAt this point  , the audience has grown as cold and detached as Estella \'s   character  , and could n\'t   care less about the two characters .  ^\n\nThe bulk of the blame here falls upon Gwyneth Paltrow .   ^\n\nShe fails to imbue Estella  , a remote character in the book  , with even the vaguest traces of humanity .   ^\n\nThere \'s   obviously something wrong when  , watching the film  , you \'re   more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character .  ^\n\nWithout a strong Estella  , Finn \'s   obsession seems baseless .  ^\n\nYou wish he would just stop whining  , let Estella marry his rival  , Walter Plane ( an oddly subdued Hank Azaria  )  , and just get on with his life .  ^\n\nIn fact  , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot .   ^\n\nFinn \'s   relationship with his brother-in-law  , Joe  , is interesting  , if a bit stereotypical .   ^\n\nWhat \'s   more fascinating are his interactions with DeNiro .   ^\n\nAlthough it \'s   only a bit part  , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create .  ^\n\nIt is apparent that director Alfonso Cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film .   ^\n\nSome of the shots work  , but others are too obviously staged ( for example  , both of the water fountain scenes  ) to have any impact .   ^\n\nFinn \'s   art ( actually the creations of Italian painter  , Francesco Clemente  ) is used throughout the film  , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect .   ^\n\nWe never see why Finn would generate this style of art  , which is simultaneously crude and insightful .   ^\n\nAs a result  , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film .  ^\n\nModernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see William Shakespeare \'s   Romeo+Juliet  ) .   ^\n\nSimply update the action to a modern setting  , and apply plenty of modern rock .   ^\n\nBut such adornments do little to perk up Great Expectations .   ^\n\nAs much as I dreaded the novel when I first read it  , you \'d   probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film .

 ^\n\nIn this film  , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark .  ^\n\nThey did n\'t   much like each other at first  ; eventually  , they started to respect one another .  ^\n\nOne of Jaws  \' great scenes involved the would-be-Ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories .  ^\n\nThis is the sort of male-bonding foreign to Bay or his producer  , Jerry Bruckheimer  , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we \'ll   care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end .  ^\n\nNot once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-I \'d   be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before  \" action  \" was called .  ^\n\nA male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps I cannot relate to a bunch of men who do n\'t   bare their souls  , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery .  ^\n\nTo this  , I will respond that the boys in ARMAGEDDON are neither heroic  , nor brave  , nor smart  , even  : this team could n\'t   build a birdhouse .  ^\n\nAnd if I get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-I \'ve   never been a prouder wimp my whole life  .'

cv645_17078.txt,'Jawbreaker is the very definition of a  \" rip-off .  \"   ^\n\nThis uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts Carrie ( 1976  )  , Heathers ( 1989  ) and Clueless ( 1995  ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clichs . ^\n\nAlong the way writer/director Darren Stein forgets to give the film a life of its own .  ^\n\nThe film opens with a voice over from geeky Fern Mayo ( Judy Greer  ) about the four most popular girls at Reagan High  : Courtney Shayne ( Rose McGowan  ) who can basically be summed up as Satan in heels  , Julie Freeman ( Rebecca Gayheart  ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel  , Marcie Fox ( Julie Benz  ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her  \" Foxy  \"  , and Liz Purr ( Charlotte Roldan  ) an angel in disguise .   ^\n\nLiz is everyone \'s   favorite because she \'s   both beautiful and kind .  ^\n\nLiz is about to turn 17 and  , as a prank  , Courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping Liz on her birthday morning .   ^\n\nIn order to keep Liz from making any noise Courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her .   ^\n\nThey then stuff Liz in the trunk of Courtney \'s   car but when they open it later  , Polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment  , their lives will never be the same  : poor Liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at Liz \'s   dead body  ) .  ^\n\nCourtney  , thinking fast  , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and Marcie and a reluctant Julie assist her .   ^\n\nThings get complicated when Fern discovers what the three girls are up to .   ^\n\nIn order to keep her quiet Courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky Fern into  \" Vylette  \"  , hoping that she will also help to replace Liz in the minds of the devastated students .  ^\n\nUp until about this point the film is effective enough .   ^\n\nHowever  , an investigation begins into Liz \'s   death and the film becomes excessively dull .  ^\n\nThe recently rediscovered talents of Pam Grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of Detective Vera Cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch .  ^\n\nCourtney \'s   plan to frame a sleazy guy ( Marilyn Manson  , in a brief cameo  ) is never believable for a second .  ^\n\nMeanwhile  , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot .   ^\n\nJulie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor Zack ( Chad Christ  ) .   ^\n\nHe apparently gives her the courage to turn on Courtney but the way things develop only make Julie look stupid .   ^\n\nFern \'s   rise to popularity is equally lame .    ^\n\nWe do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality  ) during this section .   ^\n\nIt \'s   a smart and subversive bit where Courtney gets the high school \'s   resident jock stud Dane ( Ethan Erickson  ) to demonstrate  , using a popsicle  , exactly what he would like for her to do to him .   ^\n\nIt at least provides us with a look at Courtney \'s   personality but the way the scene finishes does n\'t   make any sense .  ^\n\nStein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting .   ^\n\nWilliam Katt and P.J. Soles ( students in Carrie  ) are Liz \'s   distraught parents  , Jeff Conaway ( from Grease ( 1978  )  ) is Julie \'s   creepy single dad and Carol Kane ( the frightened babysitter in When a Stranger Calls ( 1979  )  ) camps it up as principal Miss Sherman .  ^\n\nAt times Jawbreaker feels simply like Teen Cinema \'s   Greatest Hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer .   ^\n\nThe only notable aspect of Jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look .   ^\n\nThe costume design by Vickie Brinkford and the production design by Jerry Fleming are both bright and vivid .   ^\n\nThey were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color .   ^\n\nDirector of photography Amy Vicent  , who beautifully lensed Eve \'s   Bayou ( 1997  )  , does a remarkable job here as well .   ^\n\nShot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive .  ^\n\nPerformances are mostly sub-par with McGowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in The Doom Generation ( 1995  ) and Scream ( 1996  )  ) and Gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty .   ^\n\nNone of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer Tatyana Ali  , who has a small role as a cheerleader .   ^\n\nThe male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like  \" Auto Stud  ,  \"  \" College Stud  ,  \" and  \" High School Stud #2 .  \"  ^\n\nThe soundtrack is decent and Imperial Teen \'s   catchy  \" Yoo Hoo  \" makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film  .'

Cinematography by    Christopher Doyle and Chang Hui-kung     Every country has , eventually , its New Wave .^\n\nFrance had its Nouvelle Vague ,    Brazil its Cinema Novo , China its Fifth Generation , and on and on .^\n\nSome    waves just take longer than others , before they wash over us , cleansing us    with the balm of discovery .^\n\nTaiwan \'s  New Wave came in the 1980s , in the work    of directors like Hou Hsiao-hsien , Wan Jen , and Edward Yang ; THAT DAY , ON    THE BEACH -- Yang \'s  first feature -- is central .^\n\nIt created a new language for    young Taiwanese directors , even if the first attempts to speak that language    were hesitant and faltering .^\n\nLater works refined the techniques that Yang    first explored here , giving Taiwan a distinctive international presence .   ^\n\nTHAT DAY itself is long and frustrating , the document of a nation \'s  attempt    to find a voice .    ^\n\nIt does not lack ambition .^\n\nIt anatomizes urban life in modern Taiwan , in the    manner  of  Antonioni , elaborating the alienation that the Westernized    white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned    roles -- dedicated career men , loyal housewives -- that they find unfulfilling .   ^\n\nJia-li ( Sylvia Chang ) is the focus , but the film brings others into its    compass -- her husband , her brother , friends from her college days -- as it    charts her discontents .^\n\nNo one is happy .^\n\nJia-li married her husband , We-lei ,    at a young age .^\n\nAt the time , her brother had been urged into an arranged    marriage , despite his affection for another woman , and so Jia-li \'s  marriage    seemed , in comparison , a good one : she chose We-lei of her own free will ,    they loved each other .^\n\nBut it goes wrong .    ^\n\nTHAT DAY dutifully presents all the clichs : We-lei becomes absorbed in his    career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; Jia-li feels restless and    trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems    wise .^\n\nThe film never redeems these clichs by conveying the feel of authentic    experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and    belaboured .    ^\n\nIt unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in    Vienna ,  where Jia-li meets her brother \'s  old flame ( Teresa Hu ) , now a    concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college .^\n\nBoth women seem rather    sad ,  and resigned to their sadness .^\n\nTheir circumstances ( and those of    Jia-li \'s  brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have    made the wrong choices -- married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path ,    etc. -- but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate .^\n\nIt is    not that Jia-li married the wrong man ; she did n\'t  .^\n\nThe problem is that she    needed to marry at all -- and that if she did not marry , she would still be    just as unhappy .^\n\nFor a woman in modern Taiwan , THAT DAY tells us , the cards    are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house    always wins .    ^\n\nThe film \'s  sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it    caused such controversy upon its release in Taiwan .^\n\nSeen now , it does not    seem provocative .^\n\nIndeed , it \'s  hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate    enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it    may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull .^\n\nAnd what was new    for Taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : Yang adopts methods    established years before by Antonioni and others , and his use of those    methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined .^\n\nNor does he bring anything    new -- other than the locale -- to the material .    ^\n\nThere are moments when THAT DAY takes on some of the emotional richness it    strives for -- in a young couple \'s  first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a    woman  and her husband \'s  mistress -- but they are brief .^\n\nToo often , Yang    devotes   needless   time   to   mundane   scenes -- grocery   shopping ,    flower-arranging -- in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion    imparted .^\n\nPerhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective ,    inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have    been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating .^\n\nBut Jia-li and her disaffected    companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at    length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties .^\n\nAt two hours    and  forty-five  minutes ,  it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently    long-winded .    ^\n\nConsider the defining moment for Jia-li , the titular day on the beach .^\n\nThe    thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of    that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation .   ^\n\nEven so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally ,    in case we may have missed the point .^\n\nNeedless time is devoted to expressing    what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout .    ^\n\nThe look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative .^\n\nIt was the    first feature shot by Christopher Doyle -- at least , it \'s  his name in the    credits -- who  is  now  rightly  regarded as one of the world \'s  leading    cinematographers . ^\n\nIn  the freewheeling expressionism of his work with    directors like Chen Kaige and Wong Kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning    a boring image .^\n\nYou would never know it from watching THAT DAY , which , due    either  to Doyle \'s  inexperience or Yang \'s  humdrum direction , is almost    perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab    and banal as possible .^\n\nIn scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , THAT    DAY manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage ,    none of the heartbreak .

T. is remotely appealing , but his one potentially intriguing    quality , his ineptitude , is never developed .^\n\nIn fact , Kilmer disappears    during the middle of the film , just when his admiration for Karen could have    made for an interesting sub-plot .    ^\n\nI might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to    a caper comedy , but THE REAL MCCOY goes nowhere fast .^\n\nVarious scenes of    sneaking and skulking seem to take forever , and some end with no reason    evident  why  they  did n\'t   end up on the cutting room floor .^\n\nEven the    reasonably  clever  climactic  break-in falls victim to this syndrome ,    including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts ( I    kid you not ) four minutes .^\n\nThere is no tension in the scene , just tedium .   ^\n\nRussell Mulcahy ( HIGHLANDER ) is a director with some style , and indeed THE    REAL MCCOY looks reasonably good , but he completely stumbles in the editing    room .    ^\n\nThere are so many big problems with THE REAL MCCOY that I \'m  tempted to    overlook the little ones .^\n\nLike Karen disarming one of Schmidt \'s  henchmen and    throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing .^\n\nLike a    fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few    moments later .    ^\n\nTempted .^\n\nBut I \'m  pretty good at resisting temptation .

ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public .   ^\n\nA little imagination goes a long way .  ^\n\nIn Richard Donner \'s   CONSPIRACY THEORY  , Jerry Fletcher ( Mel Gibson  ) is a New York City cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything .   ^\n\nHis latest  , that NASA is trying to kill the President by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle  , might sound outrageous to us  , but is all in a day \'s   work for him .   ^\n\nHe combs the newspaper  , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes  , and from there Jerry draws his conclusions .  ^\n\nUpstanding citizen that he is  , he tries to convince Alice Sutton ( Julia Roberts  ) of the Justice Department that the President must be warned .   ^\n\nLucky gal  , Alice  , who met Jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since .   ^\n\nWhat she does n\'t   know is that Jerry \'s   interest in her is far more than  , well  , professional .   ^\n\nHe goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment .   ^\n\nBut when some secret government types seem to take an interest in Jerry \'s   ideas and his limited-circulation  \" Conspiracy Theory  \" newsletter  , he finds himself in danger and in real need of Alice \'s   help .  ^\n\nOne of the problems with CONSPIRACY THEORY is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action  , nor a significant number of thrills .   ^\n\nPart of this is a result of the film \'s   slow pace .   ^\n\nIt takes forever to set up the relationship between Jerry and Alice  , and even once that is over with  , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement .   ^\n\nAt over two hours  , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it \'s   running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour  , but even then  , the action scenes would not be able to save the film .   ^\n\nInstead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces  , we \'re   treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite  \" black elements  \"  :  Black helicopter  , men in black action suits and body armor  , black vehicles - you know the drill .  ^\n\nThey come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons  , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time .   ^\n\nBig deal  , we \'ve   seen it all before .   ^\n\nWatching the film  , I wished Donner had at least tried to use a little imagination  , but I was out of luck .  ^\n\nNow  , when I say it took forever to set up the  \" relationship  \" between Jerry and Alice  , I completely mean what one person is relative to the other  , and not romantic involvement .   ^\n\nOh  , Donner and screenwriter Brian Helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie  , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other  , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring .   ^\n\nYou see  , there were more sparks between Gibson and Danny Glover in the LETHAL WEAPON movies ( also directed by Donner  ) than between Gibson and Roberts in CONSPIRACY THEORY .   ^\n\nThe two just do n\'t   click  , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause Alice to reject Jerry altogether ( like finding out he \'s   been stalking her  )  , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced .  ^\n\nThe script in general also seems forced  , like someone sat Helgeland down and forced him to write it  , then took it and forced it upon us .  ^\n\nDialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable  , to the point that I almost stopped listening .   ^\n\nEven Gibson \'s   usual gift for ad lib could n\'t   punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest  , although one of Jerry \'s   theories about Oliver Stone was mildly amusing .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , much of what \'s   discussed in the film is not inherently important to what \'s   going on  , but instead filler that starts out with potential  , but ends up just being extraneous because it \'s   never followed through .   ^\n\nFor example  , Jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a New York subway station .   ^\n\nHe even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station  )  , and that the coroner should check the man \'s   lungs for chlorine .   ^\n\nThis is convincing enough to Alice that she seems to believe him .   ^\n\nYou know what happens then  ?   ^\n\nNothing  , zip  , nada .   ^\n\nNo follow-up whatsoever  , so what \'s   the significance  ?   ^\n\nOkay  , here \'s   another one .   ^\n\nA couple of well known ( real life  ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the J.D. Salinger novel  \" The Catcher in the Rye  \" .   ^\n\nJerry also has a bunch of copies .   ^\n\nWhenever he goes into a bookstore  , he has to buy one .   ^\n\nLeaving out the question of whether or not this makes Jerry an assassin  , we \'re   never given a reason to believe WHY this would make him an assassin .   ^\n\nNot when we find out about his Salinger collection  , not when he goes to the bookstore  , not later on when we get the answer to our first question .   ^\n\nThe point becomes totally extraneous .  ^\n\nOh  , did I mention that Patrick Stewart is in this film  ?   ^\n\nYeah  , he plays this government psychiatrist named Dr. Jonas who may or may not be a bad guy .   ^\n\nThat \'s   about it .   ^\n\nFor all the presence this usually marvelous actor has  , he \'s   nearly forgettable in CONSPIRACY THEORY .  ^\n\nYou can just lump him in with the supporting players  , with the exception of Cylk Cozart who plays Agent Lowry of the FBI .   ^\n\nThis guy was really likable  , and I wish he and his character had gotten more screen time .  ^\n\nOkay  , here \'s   my theory .   ^\n\nThis really started out as a great film  , but some of its jokes were actually true  !   ^\n\nThe government came in and forced Donner to make edits for the sake of national security  , and this was what was left over .

cv656_25395.txt,'What better for the Farrelly Brothers  , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter  , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality  ?  ^\n\nIt \'s   exactly the sort of thing the Brothers relish  : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness  )  , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh .  ^\n\nJim Carrey \'s   signed on too  ?  ^\n\nEven better .  ^\n\nThe National Alliance for the Mentally Ill even helped out by levying complaints against the Brothers  \' new film before its opening  , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality  , labeling it incorrectly as  \" schizophrenia  ,  \" and so forth .  ^\n\nSuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would  , of course  , only add more fuel to the Farrelly Brothers  \' fire  , proving that some people just could n\'t   take a joke  , and that the Farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy .  ^\n\nYes  , it all seemed perfect  , but one thing went wrong  : Their movie is n\'t   funny .  ^\n\nIt \'s   not for lack of trying .  ^\n\nThe Farrellys utilize in  \" Me  , Myself & Irene  \" their most high-concept premise ever  : Carrey plays Charlie Baileygaites  , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver  , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them .  ^\n\nThis  , of course  , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature  , making his job as a Rhode Island state trooper increasingly difficult .  ^\n\nSoon enough  , Charlie \'s   repressed aggression manifests itself into a second  , independent personality named Hank  , a deep-voiced  , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster .  ^\n\nThis guy is n\'t   above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he \'s   been insulted  , or holding a little girl \'s   head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street .  ^\n\nThen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the Farrellys have ever attempted  , and the film runs off its tracks .  ^\n\nSome have suggested that this is n\'t   a problem  , because the Farrelly Brothers  \' brand of humor does n\'t   require plot to work .  ^\n\nThey \'re   wrong  , of course  : Plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the Farrellys  \' last effort  , 1996 \'s    \" There \'s   Something About Mary .  \"  ^\n\n( 1999 \'s    \" Outside Providence  \" was technically an earlier project .  )  ^\n\nThe brothers  \' earlier film was n\'t   funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe  )  , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected .  ^\n\nIn  \" Mary  ,  \" the Farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick  : They \'d   have you thinking the story was going one way  , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion .  ^\n\n\" Me  , Myself & Irene  ,  \" by contrast  , seems to have been made by folks who looked at  \" Mary  \" and saw only the surface grossness  , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work .  ^\n\nHaving been produced by the same guys who made  \" Mary  ,  \"  \" Irene  \" seems like an even bigger disappointment .  ^\n\nThe brothers pile on the offensive humor  , taking shots at race  , midgets  , albinos  , mental illness  , and all manner of bathroom jokes .  ^\n\nBut they have n\'t   come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of  \" Me  , Myself & Irene  \" comes off as rote  , by-the-numbers  , adolescent comedy .  ^\n\nThe plot  , with Carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive Irene P. Waters ( Renee Zellweger  )  , who \'s   in more trouble than anyone knows  , back to New York  , has an ending that \'s   entirely predictable from the get-go .  ^\n\n( Think Charlie and Irene will fall in love  ?  ^\n\nYeah  , me too .  )  ^\n\nThe Farrellys then introduce scores of different characters  , and none of them ever manage to do anything you have n\'t   already expected them to do  , no matter how outrageous their actions might be .  ^\n\nCompared to the curveballs the Farrellys are used to throwing  , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed  , presenting an obvious problem  : When gross-out humor loses its shock value  , it \'s   no longer funny  , merely gross .  ^\n\nThe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry .  ^\n\nTake  , for example  , the subplot involving Charlie \'s   three Black sons ( Anthony Anderson  , Mongo Brownlee  , Jerod Mixon  ) .  ^\n\nThe incongruity of it all is funny for a while  , with three burly Black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread Carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face .  ^\n\nBut by the end of the film  , they \'re   still doing the same schitck it has n\'t   been elevated to another  , funnier level  , and it has n\'t   been dropped either .  ^\n\nThat \'s   too bad  , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through .  ^\n\n\" Me  , Myself & Irene  \" reeks of wasted opportunities .  ^\n\nThere ought to be more focus on how other people react to Charlie \'s   new personality  , and on how Charlie deals with the consequences of Hank \'s   actions .  ^\n\nThis does n\'t   really happen nearly every supporting character learns about Charlie \'s   condition early on  , so they do n\'t   have any opportunity to be surprised by it .  ^\n\nThe film throws what looks like a patented Farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion Charlie and Irene pick up called  , appropriately  ,  \" Whitey  \"  )  , but the script does n\'t   go anywhere with it  , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax .  ^\n\nJim Carrey is a gifted comedian  , both physically and vocally  , but he \'s   left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to Steve Martin in  \" All of Me .  \"  ^\n\nIt \'s   a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting  , but none of it is terribly funny .  ^\n\nCarrey does n\'t   pull any stunts we do n\'t   expect him to pull  , and the Farrellys  \' script does n\'t   give him anything else to pull  : The situations in which he must perform the role-shifting are n\'t   set up in any meaningful way .  ^\n\nPerhaps Carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better .  ^\n\nZellweger \'s   Irene is not a strong female lead Mary in  \" Mary  \" may have been part adolescent fantasy  , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed .  ^\n\nIrene is nothing in particular  , as the film never makes clear whether she \'s   ditzy  , clever  , or neither .  ^\n\nAs such  , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only  \" sane  \" person in the film .  ^\n\nChris Cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt FBI agent  , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this .  ^\n\nHe  , like the others  , does absolutely nothing unexpected .  ^\n\nAfter viewing the shapeless mess that  \" Me  , Myself & Irene  \" eventually dissolved into  , I was stuck wondering whether or not the Farrellys had outsmarted themselves .  ^\n\nMaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked .  ^\n\nBut I do n\'t   believe it --   good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style .  ^\n\nIf the Farrellys are indeed good  , smart filmmakers ( and I still think they are  )  , they \'ll   rebound just fine .  ^\n\nEven after that happens  , though  , I \'ll   still consider  \" Me  , Myself & Irene  \" to be a high-caliber misfire  .'

cv659_21483.txt,'I   came   to   an   epiphany   while   watching   THE   BACHELOR ,  an    innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy .^\n\nIt \'s  not the sort of film    in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was    nonetheless .^\n\nI sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when    suddenly I realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic    comedy genre circa 1999 .^\n\nIn a word , it \'s  the same thing that \'s  wrong with so    many movies circa 1999 : writing .^\n\nMore to the point , it \'s  the refusal to    acknowledge that characterizations matter when you \'re  telling a story about    a relationship .^\n\nTHE BACHELOR is merely the latest in a long line of films    where  we \'re  expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive ,    pleasant people just because they \'re  attractive and pleasant .    ^\n\nIn this particular case , Attractive and Pleasant Exhibit A is Jimmy Shannon    ( Chris O\'Donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but    surely sucked into marriage .^\n\nIt \'s  a scary notion for Jimmy , even though he    dearly loves Attractive and Pleasant Exhibit B Anne ( Renee Zellweger ) , his    girlfriend of three years .^\n\nConvinced despite his reservations that it \'s  time    to \" sht or get off the pot , \" Jimmy proposes to Anne --  very badly .^\n\nAnne    refuses ,  which leaves Jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric    grandfather ( Peter Ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will .   ^\n\nJimmy stands to inhereit $ 100 million if he is married by 6:05 p.m. on his    30th birthday , stays married foryears and produces a child .^\n\nThere are only a    couple of minor problems : 1 ) Jimmy \'s  30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) Anne    is nowhere to be found , meaning Jimmy has to find another willing bride from    among his many ex-girlfriends .    ^\n\nIt \'s  a wacky , BREWSTER \'S  MILLIONS-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one    of the film \'s  better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a    shallow and materialistic guy learns What Really Matters .^\n\nAt least that    would  be  the  case  if Jimmy were n\'t  already a world-class altruist .   ^\n\nScreenwriter  Steve Cohen slides into the story an even more draconian    condition in the will : If Jimmy does n\'t  get married , not only will he lose    all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from    under him , costing hudreds of jobs .^\n\nFrom the outset , Jimmy \'s  motivation    is n\'t  cash ; it \'s  the livelihoods of his devoted employees .^\n\nIt \'s  almost    embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in THE BACHELOR \'s     plot development .^\n\nBy any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless .    ^\n\nAnd that \'s  the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like THE BACHELOR    --  the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to    happiness .^\n\nThere \'s  never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers ,    because there \'s  no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake .^\n\nThe    blandly nice O\'Donnell could n\'t  pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the    filmmakers do n\'t  even let him ; Zellweger \'s  Anne may have issues with her    sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to ,    but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged .^\n\nAnd    forget about seeing enough of Jimmy and Anne together to feel invested in    their potential reconciliation .^\n\nThe parade of sit-com set pieces had better    be damned funny , since they \'re  all that stands between us and a blissfully    sweet foregone conclusion .    ^\n\nI \'ll  admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including Ustinov \'s     rantings  about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men    popping questions and champagne corks .^\n\nFar more of them are either tedious    or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of Brooke Shields as    an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds    of potential brides gather in a church .^\n\nYou \'re  never going to get too many    raucous belly laughs from a film like THE BACHELOR , but that \'s  not the real    problem . ^\n\nNor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of    warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it \'s  leading up to .^\n\nThe problem are a beginning and    middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy --  there \'s  no spark , no energy , no    humanity .^\n\nIt \'s  an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer \'s     digestions .^\n\nWe \'ve  reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic    wish fulfillment do n\'t  even have a pulse .^\n\nTHE BACHELOR is love among the    mannequins . \n'

cv663_14484.txt,'What hath Kevin Williamson wrought  ?   ^\n\nWhile the horror movie revival spurred on by his _Scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre --  _I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_  , _Halloween:_H20_  , and _Scream_2_ --  it must be noted that Williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films .   ^\n\nThose Williamson-less post-_Scream_ efforts  , among them _Wishmaster_ and the recent _Disturbing_Behavior_  , have been frightening all right --  frighteningly  , insultingly _bad_ .   ^\n\nAdd to that list _Urban_Legend_  , which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy .  ^\n\nThe influence of Williamson on screenwriter Silvio Horta is clear in two key areas .   ^\n\nFirst  , the opening sequence  , like that of _Scream_  , is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling .   ^\n\nThis sequence  , in which Pendleton College coed Michelle Mancini ( Natasha Gregson Wagner  ) is decapitated while driving  , also reveals the other obviously Williamson-esque touch  : the killer \'s   look .   ^\n\nDressed in a large hooded parka  , wielding an axe  , the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the _I_Know  ... _fisherman  , sans the hook .  ^\n\nOne thing Horta does not borrow from Williamson  , however  , is the intriguing premise .   ^\n\nStudents at Pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends --  those contemporary bits of  \" mythology  \" passed from person to person  , group to group  , year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness .   ^\n\nIt hardly matters if they are true or not  , such as the tall tale that Mikey from the Life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of Pop Rocks and Pepsi ( he did n\'t    ) .   ^\n\nMichelle  , slain by the  \" killer lurking in the backseat  \" of lore  , is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true  ; as the body count rises  , fellow Pendleton student Natalie ( Alicia Witt  ) suspects not only a link between the murders  , but a personal link to her past as well .  ^\n\nThe setup shows promise  , but the story never takes off  , due in large part to Horta and the director  , the aptly named Jamie Blanks  , who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares .   ^\n\nToo many of the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues  , and the film \'s   chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _Scream_ tried to subvert  , like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should --  and could --  run out the front door .   ^\n\nBut that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches  ; there \'s   also the climactic villain confession  , in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is revealed  , not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick  , which is a cliche in any film genre .   ^\n\nBanks and Horta \'s   ( intentional  ) attempts at humor are also lame  ; the fact that the best gags are lazy  , in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars Joshua Jackson and Rebecca Gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor .   ^\n\nSome laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed  , but I \'m   not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so .  ^\n\nThe filmmakers do n\'t   get much help from their onscreen talent .   ^\n\nI was far from a fan of bland _I_Know  ... _ starlet Jennifer Love Hewitt  , but I \'d   talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic Witt  , whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter  ; Witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence-challenged leading man  , Jared Leto.  _Dawson\'s_Creek_ star Jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo  ; Gayheart displays all the depth and range of  , well  , a Noxzema spokeswoman  ; and Robert Englund lends the film little more than his Freddy Krueger pedigree as a folklore professor .   ^\n\nGranted  , the cast is hampered by their material .   ^\n\nLoretta Devine  , who has done some fine work in films such as _Waiting_to_Exhale_  , is saddled with the ridiculous role of a Pam Grier-worshiping campus security guard .  ^\n\nThe recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man --  namely  , Kevin Williamson --  to stay alive .   ^\n\nIf other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _Urban_Legend_  , the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers  \' many victims .

it \'s  pathetic    and brainless .^\n\nThe film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their    wrestlers  but  not  all  wrestling  fans are that way .^\n\nI watch it for    entertainment and I would think some people would take offense to what is    said throughout the movie .^\n\nThe main characters in the film actually get to    wrestle ,  like that would happen to any fan , especially tothat stalk a    wrestler and sneak him back onto set .^\n\nAlso , I wondered how they got into the    backstage so easily ;

cv675_22871.txt,'Have you ever been in an automobile accident where you\'ve miraculously    walked away with only a few scratches, yet the car has been obliterated into    an unrecognizable, mangled wreck?^\n\nWell , that has never actually happened to    me and I hope that none of us will ever experience this situation .^\n\nBut after    watching  this  inane  exercise of a movie , I certainly feel that I \'ve     miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly    careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond .    ^\n\nOddly , `Eye of the Beholder,\' which is a psychological-romance-thriller ,    starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a    British Intelligence agent , called The Eye ( Ewan McGregor ) , working in    Washington DC .^\n\nIn the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across    the street in his office with his pants down .^\n\nUsing an array of high-tech    surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures    of the bared lawyer to PC screens and fax machines in his office .^\n\nThe law    firm \'s  employees get a good chuckle .^\n\nThe audience gets a good chuckle .    ^\n\nThe Eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman    ( Ashley Judd ) .^\n\nThere is something compelling about this mysterious woman .   ^\n\nDespite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with    a propensity to kill men that get too close to her .^\n\nAfter the murders , she    sobs while singing the Christmas tune `Little Bluebirds \' and laments about    being abandoned by her father long ago .^\n\nAfter each killing , she puts on a    different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state .    ^\n\nThe Eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions .^\n\nBut he does not    alert the authorities .^\n\nHe somehow empathizes with her sense of loss .^\n\nThe    Eye , it turns out , also is haunted by his past .^\n\nHis daughter was taken away    from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life .^\n\nHis tormented    psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in    conversation .^\n\nShe becomes a sort of spectral adviser , and one thing that the    ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman .^\n\nHe now diverts his    energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation .^\n\nIt does n\'t     matter that he has witnessed all of her murders .^\n\nAnd it does n\'t  matter that    The Eye is abnormally reticent , hiding his entire life behind computer    screens .^\n\nHe follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every    move to keep her out of trouble .^\n\nWhen a crazed druggie ( Jason Priestley )    attacks her , he shows up for some quick butt kicking .^\n\nWhen the police are    closing in to arrest her , he provides a distraction so that she can escape .   ^\n\nAll the while , the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and The Eye    stays just out of sight .^\n\nPeculiar .    ^\n\nHow bad is this movie ?^\n\nI refer you to my `Review Quote Source\' litmus test .   ^\n\nJust take a look at the full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are    pulling quotes .^\n\nFor this movie , they are from magazines called `Flaunt\' and    `Mirabella.\'^\n\nNo doubt , they were impressed with Judd \'s  series of catwalks    and disguise changes .^\n\nThe major problem with `Eye of the Beholder\' is that    the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination .^\n\nIf it was    a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced .^\n\nIf it was a love story ,    there was absolutely no emotional pull .^\n\nCompletely disjointed in structure ,    it \'s  only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite    car commercial ( the one where the `6\' on the tachometer dissolves into a    winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a    child \'s  train set ) .^\n\nI am also still hopeful that Ashley Judd will find a    serious role to showcase her potential talents .^\n\nBeyond that , the film is    hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and    handling .

cv676_22202.txt,'Starring Dolly Reed; Cynthia Myers; Marcia McBroom; John Lazar & Michael    Blodgett     Bad.^\n\nBad .^\n\nBad .^\n\nThat one word seems to pretty much sums up Beyond The Valley    Of The Dolls .^\n\nIf that summary is n\'t  enough for you , how about T&A , T&A , T&A ?   ^\n\nStill have n\'t  got the point ?^\n\nOther than director Russ Meyer \'s  predilection    for  casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the    afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to    recommend even taking a look at this movie .^\n\nThat is the fact that it was    co-written by famed film critic Roger Ebert , who also was responsible for    the screenplay .^\n\nAfter watching this movie you will never be able to sit    through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for    bad writing with a straight face .^\n\nThis movie stinks out loud .^\n\nQuite frankly ,    this movie deserves aout of 10 .^\n\nBut there are parts of it that are so bad    they are almost funny .^\n\nSo I \'m  giving it aout of 10 .^\n\nAnd maybe that is too    generous .    ^\n\nRight from the opening credits , I knew that I had a class-A bomb on my    hands .^\n\nNot only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the    first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a    guy  in a nazi uniform .^\n\nI had absolutely no idea why the hell that was    happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is    over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene .^\n\nTo be honest , as I sat through    this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , I actually forgot    about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in    the film .^\n\nWith the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it    would n\'t  have surprised me if the opening had never been explained .    ^\n\nSo what is this movie about ? you ask .^\n\nLike it really matters .^\n\nOK , here goes .   ^\n\nThis all-girl band headed by Kelly MacNamara ( Dolly Reed ) and her friends go    to Hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry .^\n\nOnce there ,    they do manage to find success ( Due as much to their hooters as anything    else it sure was n\'t  for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie    chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get    to them .^\n\nEverything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex    sends  them  on a downward spiral .^\n\nThere are a couple of other idiotic    subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty    much sums up this thing.     >From a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here .^\n\nOther than the    above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that Russ Meyer seemed to have .   ^\n\nThe dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts .^\n\nMr.    Ebert has generously thrown in helpings of \" hey man\",\"dig \" and my all time    favorite --  \" this is my happening , and it freaks me out \" .^\n\nNow I ask you ,    with lines like that how can you go wrong ?^\n\nEbert had tried to inject as many    big words as possible into the dialogue .^\n\nMaybe he thought it would make the    movie  seem  smarter .^\n\nI do n\'t  know , but all the big words in the world    would n\'t  be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting .    ^\n\nBut the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of    everything else in this movie .^\n\nI \'ve  seen home movies directed better than    Meyer managed with this turkey .^\n\nIn fact , there is one scene --  the one in    which they are in a van driving to Hollywood to make their fortunes --     during which I really had to question if Meyer or his editors had just    suffered serious head injuries .^\n\nAdd to the directing and writing the music    in this movie .^\n\nI almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was    broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers .    ^\n\nThen we have the cast .^\n\nFirst lets start David Gurian who played Harris , the    manager of the band .^\n\nThis has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has    ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera .^\n\nSadly , his acting does n\'t     come close to making up for his looks .^\n\nIf you have been following along up    to this point , this should n\'t  surprise you .^\n\nMeyer \'s  stable of well endowed    girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with    their other assets .^\n\nDolly Reed plays Kelly , the leader of the band .^\n\nAnd no    surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents .^\n\nAnd yes , she    does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents .^\n\nSadly ,    her ass is almost as large as her chest .^\n\nHey , it a sexist movie , so I \'m     writing a sexist review .^\n\nThen we have former Playboy Playmate Cynthia Myers    in a fairly small role as Casey , one of the other band members .^\n\nThis goes    along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie .^\n\nMeyer casts a    gorgeous Playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting    talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all .   ^\n\nSure  Russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed    shadows .^\n\nOn the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene .^\n\nI sound like I \'m     writing a review in a porn magazine .^\n\nBut hey , I \'ll  admit it ; the only reason    that I actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look    at Cynthia Myers naked .^\n\nAnd since that was a huge disappointment , I pretty    much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey .    ^\n\nThe only thing that I can say about this movie is that you should stay away    from it .^\n\nUnless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing    that even a Pulitzer Prize winning film critic like Roger Ebert has screwed    up at least once in his life too .^\n\nAnd if you are thinking of checking it out    for the double D \'s  --  you are better off just downloading nude Cynthia Myers    pictures off the Internet .^\n\nThis is a movie that should be avoided at all    costs .^\n\nAn even better idea might be to require video stores to place a    warning on the box of Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls --  Beware : This movie    is extremely hazardous to your common sense .^\n\nProceed with extreme caution .

Jane \" ) opts to play Sam Loomis as a    cowboy/hick , which would have been nice if he had gone PAST that starting    point .^\n\nSam has a twang and a cowboy hat , but that \'s  about it .^\n\nMortensen    turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory .^\n\nAnne Heche ,    in the Janet Leigh role , does a few good things in her brief time on screen .   ^\n\nAt least her Marion Crane has a LITTLE life in her , which ca n\'t  be said for    most  of the rest of the cast .^\n\nThe best work , though , comes from Vince    Vaughn , as the demented Mama \'s  boy , Norman Bates .^\n\nHe \'s  not going to make    anyone forget Anthony Perkins , but he is effective both in being naughty and    nice .^\n\nThe best part of the film is the dinner scene Heche and Vaughn , where    they simply talk .^\n\nThere is some solid acting there , something that is not    carried through the rest of the film .^\n\nVan Sant has made a BORING film .^\n\nAll    the  camera tricks that Hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 are n\'t  as    eye-catching now .^\n\nWhat passed for brilliance then has been copied so many    times by so many directors that they do n\'t  impress or excite .^\n\nVan Sant , in    what  I  assume  is  a  grasp  at  originality ,  decided  to  put some    stream-of-consciousness images into a few famous scenes ( was that a lamb in    the middle of the road ? )^\n\nThese images , included with some questionable    editing choices , took away from the scenes themselves and caused , at first ,    bewilderment and , later , laughter .^\n\nDefinitely NOT Hitchcock \'s  intention !^\n\nAt    least Danny Elfman had the good sense to not mess with Bernard Herrmann \'s     original  famous  and terrific score .^\n\nIf a film like \" Psycho \" does not    frighten , then what \'s  the point .^\n\nAside from Norman , the characters are    thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience .^\n\nThere are    things  Van  Sant  and  Company could have done to at least make their    recreation interesting .^\n\nIn the end , however , the new \" Psycho \" is a noble    attempt , but , alas , a dismal failure .

cv687_22207.txt,'Starring David Naughton; Griffin Dunne; Jenny Agutter; Don McKillop & Paul    Kember     An American Werewolf In London is John Landis\' groundbreaking feature about    an American tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old    England.^\n\nThe groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects .^\n\nMore    specifically ,  the  makeup used for the transformation of a man into a    werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character .^\n\nEven twenty    years  after  its release , that part of the movie is still impressive .   ^\n\nAlthough , I would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie    that could be considered impressive .^\n\nThe rest of the movie is a run of the    mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure .^\n\nIf it    were n\'t   for  the  cutting  edge  makeup  effects used in the werewolf    transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone    largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 .^\n\nAnd with good reason --     the  acting  is n\'t  great and neither is the writing .^\n\nWell OK , we do n\'t     actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film .^\n\nBut one    other important element is lacking here too --  it is n\'t  scary .^\n\nWith no    exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens .^\n\nYou do n\'t     even  need  the obligatory scary music to give you a hint .^\n\nI will give    director John Landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror    films that I have ever seen .^\n\nBut John , it just was n\'t  scary .^\n\nI did n\'t  know    if  this  was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole    werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to    see it , but it did n\'t  work for me .^\n\nActually , it was intended as a sort of a    spoof on horror films .^\n\nBut the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama    was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me .^\n\nIt \'s  never a good sign that    you do n\'t  realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is    long over and you read it in the background material .^\n\nCall me crazy , but you    should n\'t  have to do research on a movie to enjoy it .    ^\n\nI \'m  not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the    title  pretty  well sums the whole thing up .^\n\nWerewolf bites boy ( David    Naughton ) .^\n\nBoy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually    falls for pretty nurse ( Jenny Agutter ) and then strange things begin to    happen to boy .^\n\nIncluding , and I must admit this is a very nice touch , visits    from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up    with him in the hospital .^\n\nThe neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly    deteriorating corpse .^\n\nI know it sounds strange , but it actually works .^\n\nThe    scenes between David Naughton and the dead buddy ( Griffin Dunne ) are really    the best parts of the movie .    ^\n\nAs I said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of    the special effects .^\n\nWhile they are still impressive today , they are n\'t     impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film .^\n\nAnd    since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better    choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart    to watch .^\n\nActually , the 1998 sequel , An American Werewolf In Paris , is more    entertaining since it does n\'t  take itself as seriously and actually provides    a few more laughs along the way .

cv689_13701.txt,'In the first DEATH WISH movie  , mild-mannered New York architect Paul Kersey  , played by Charles Bronson  , was avenging the death of his wife .  ^\n\nIn the second  , he was avenging his daughter .  ^\n\nIn the third  , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend .  ^\n\nFourth movie  , on the other hand  , begins with Kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend Karen  , played by Kay Lenz .  ^\n\nHowever  , since this is DEATH WISH MOVIE  , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people Kersey cares for .  ^\n\nThis time Karen \'s   teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and Kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways .  ^\n\nKersey \'s   new targets  , unlike the previous movies  , are n\'t   the ordinary street punks but rich  , heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers .  ^\n\nEven such unstoppable killing machine like Kersey needs some support  , and it comes from the publisher Nathan White ( John P. Ryan  )  , determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter .  ^\n\nWhite \'s   plan is to make Kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them .  ^\n\nThe plan begins to take shape  , but Kersey \'s   actions bring attention of two police detectives - Reiner ( George Dickerson  ) and Nozaki ( Soon Teck-Oh  ) .  ^\n\nFourth ( and  , unfortunately  , not the final  ) installment in the DEATH WISH series  , will probably remembered as the typical movie of Cannon Group  , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade .  ^\n\nHowever  , although some critics might argue  , DEATH WISH 4  : THE CRACKDOWN represents slight improvement over the DEATH WISH 3 .  ^\n\nPaul Kersey  , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial  ) characters of the 1970s  , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script  , and Charles Bronson really does n\'t   feel the need to put much effort in his acting .  ^\n\nHowever  , the hand of a veteran director J. Lee Thompson seems more capable of Michael Winner \'s   and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal  , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring .  ^\n\nThere are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence  , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end .  ^\n\nThe script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused Kay Lenz \'s   character  ) and predates the War on Drugs campaign that would inspire many Hollywood products in next few years .  ^\n\nThere are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional  , like in a scene where Kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from Bronson \'s   1970s classics .  ^\n\n( Special note to x-philes  : Mith Pilleggi  , the actor who plays AD Skinner in THE X- FILES  , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman  ) .

cv709_11173.txt,'I can imagine how good Krippendorf \'s  Tribe must have looked on paper .^\n\nIt    does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors ,    led by the great Richard Dreyfuss and a good director ( Todd Holland ) , all    wanted to make this film .^\n\nIn fact , it is only the expertise by which this    excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting    that  you  stay  as  far away from Krippendorf \'s  Tribe as possible .^\n\nIn    retrospect , I can imagine how bad this film could have been .^\n\nI shudder at    the  possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than    Dreyfuss .    ^\n\nDreyfuss plays James Krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $ 100,000    by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in New Guinea .^\n\nHalfway into    his  two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies .^\n\nI say apparently    because when or how she dies is never truly established .^\n\nLater , we find out    that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen TVs and other such    pleasures .^\n\nSo , when Krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do    not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie .    ^\n\nHe makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video .^\n\nHe    simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls    the Shelmickedmu ) .^\n\nAudiences at Krippendorf \'s  lectures are amazed by his    findings that the Shelmickedmu practice circumcision .^\n\nAnd proof that the    typical  family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the    anthropological community .^\n\nLike all films like this , the lie becomes more    and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what    point it is all going to fall out from under our hero .    ^\n\nDreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film .^\n\nHe has lots    of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play    people like this realistically .^\n\nThis film also requires a lot of physical    humor that I \'ve  never seen Dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job .^\n\nJenna    Elfman ,  who  plays  Veronica  Mecilli ,  a  scientist  who wants in on    Krippendorf \'s  work , is also very funny and appealing here .^\n\nAnd the kid    actors are great , as well .    ^\n\nBut we \'re  talking about the script from hell .^\n\nThis is one of those stories    that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well    have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe    where things like this can happen .^\n\nBut the ridiculousness of the story is    not really what is so bad about it .^\n\nAll the cliches and the irritating plot    devices could have easily been overcome by Dreyfuss and crew .^\n\nNo , the script    is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters    that I was in disbelief as I watched .^\n\nFurthermore , the manor in which all of    this material is covered up is truly shameless .    ^\n\nTake , for instance , the scene in which Krippendorf gets Veronica drunk so he    can  tape them having sex .^\n\nThey get all decked out in the tribe getup ,    complete with paint to darken their skin .^\n\nKrippendorf does this because he    needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe .^\n\nNow , I saw this scene    coming from a mile away , but I said to myself , \" No , that would be far too    tasteless .^\n\nThere \'s  no way they \'ll  do that ... Oh God ! \"^\n\nThey did do it .^\n\nIt \'s     there .^\n\nI was almost more appalled by the fact that this did n\'t  bother the    other audience members with whom I saw this film .^\n\nI found it deplorable .^\n\nAnd    when Krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes    without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice .    ^\n\nThe  film  is  filled with scenes like these .^\n\nThey not only insult the    audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays .^\n\nIt    would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough    to fool an entire community of scientists , yet Krippendorf does it easily in    an afternoon .^\n\nAnd watching Dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared    speech is funny and entertaining , but I think that most members of the    on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as    he goes .^\n\nIf I were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely .    ^\n\nMoving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever    learned regarding African tribes .^\n\nSure , Dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is    really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of    this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it    provokes .    ^\n\nIt is because of Dreyfuss as an actor that I was able to watch this film .   ^\n\nHis  character  here  is not a good subject for a film because he is a    shameless liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he    does .^\n\nI suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case ,    but for the purposes of good taste , I would have expected something .^\n\nNo ,    this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues , and the writer    of  the  film  ( Charlie Peters ) did n\'t  include a single scene in which    Krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is    very bad .^\n\nIn fact , it \'s  his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that    he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings .    ^\n\nI suppose it \'s  important to admit that this is a funny film .^\n\nDreyfuss and    Elfman , and many of the contrived and insulting scenes , add up to a picture    that is anything but boring .^\n\nAnd if you \'re  less serious than I , you probably    will enjoy it .^\n\nI , however , ca n\'t  get past these elements .^\n\nKrippendorf \'s     Tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but this is the kind of film    that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they should n\'t  be    learning .^\n\nWith a little more insight into its story and themes , this could    have been a good movie .

cv710_23745.txt,'After a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors  , Mission To Mars ends up throwing a whiffleball .  ^\n\nFiercely unoriginal  , Director DePalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him .  ^\n\nThere are aliens similar to those in Close Encounters of the Third Kind .  ^\n\nThe stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of Robinson Crusoe on Mars .  ^\n\nThe astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of Apollo 13 .  ^\n\nInterior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001  : A Space Odyssey .  ^\n\nInstead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie  , De Palma stops right there  , refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart .  ^\n\nMission to Mars takes it \'s   first wobbly steps at a pre-launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done .  ^\n\nDuring these surface scans of the characters  , we learn that Jim McConnell ( Sinise  ) has lost his wife .  ^\n\nIt \'s   a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety .  ^\n\nThe rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability .  ^\n\nThere is no contentiousness  , no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time .  ^\n\nMaybe DePalma was going for the comraderie of The Right Stuff  , but in that movie  , the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects .  ^\n\nIt \'s   the year 2020 and this is NASA \'s   first manned excursion to the red planet .  ^\n\nA crew  , led by Luke Graham ( Cheadle  )  , arrives on Mars and quickly discovers an anomaly  , which they investigate with tragic results .  ^\n\nGraham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to Earth .  ^\n\nIn response  , Earth sends a rescue team comprised of McConnell  , Woody Blake ( Robbins  )  , wife Terri Fisher ( Nielsen  ) and Phil Ohlmyer ( O\'Connell  ) .  ^\n\nObstacles are put in the crew \'s   way and and they matter-of- factly go about solving them .  ^\n\nI should say  , McConnell goes about solving them .  ^\n\nTime and again  , McConnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind  , which would n\'t   be so bad if the rest of the crew did n\'t   come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable .  ^\n\n( Mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of Fisher in a situation where the entire crew \'s   mission and life is in mortal danger .  ^\n\nOn a team of professionals  , she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link .  ^\n\nWomen serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character \'s   personality trait .  )  ^\n\nBy the time they land on Mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred  , Mission to Mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush .  ^\n\nThere is an adage in film to  \" show  , do n\'t   tell .  \"  ^\n\nMission to Mars does both .  ^\n\nRepeatedly .  ^\n\nCharacters obsessively explain the obvious  , explain their actions as they are doing them  , explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them .  ^\n\nThe film \'s   conclusion is momumentally derivative  , anti-climatic and unsatisying .  ^\n\nAs I walked out I wondered who the target audience might be for this film .  ^\n\nThe best I could come up with is pre-teen age boys  , but in this media saturated era  , this film \'s   components would have been old hat even for them .  ^\n\nI have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a  good  , modern day B-movie .  ^\n\nThe key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material .  ^\n\nI felt no such earnestness .

cv713_29002.txt,'America \'s   Sweethearts ( 2001  )  ^\n\n\" America \'s   Sweethearts  \" has an intriguing premise and a great cast  , but it is n\'t   nearly as edgy or funny as it should be .  ^\n\nAlmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer Billy Crystal  , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting  \" Comic Relief  \" charity shows with Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence  ) .  ^\n\nCrystal ignores a simple  , but crucial  , rule  : For a screwball comedy to work  , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting  , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous .  ^\n\n\" America \'s   Sweethearts  \" takes place at a press junket  , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters .  ^\n\nIt \'s   a promising set-up  , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules  , thus dissipating the tension of the situation .  ^\n\nBy the end of the film  , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on  , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed .  ^\n\nJohn Cusack and Catherine Zeta-Jones play Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison  , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when Gwen began seeing Hector ( Hank Azaria  )  , a Spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp .  ^\n\nOf the last nine films Eddie and Gwen made together  , six crossed the $ 100 million mark  , but the prospects for their final effort  , a space opus titled  \" Time Over Time  ,  \" are far from rosy .  ^\n\nWhile Eddie has spent many months in a New Age rest clinic fretting over the breakup  , Gwen \'s   solo films have tanked .  ^\n\nTo make matter worse  , the director of the movie ( Christopher Walken  )  , a  \" visionary  \" who purchased the Unabomber \'s   cabin and had it moved to his backyard  , is withholding the film from the studio  , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket .  ^\n\nDesperate to win over the press  , the studio elects to hire Lee ( Billy Crystal  )  , a recently fired publicist  , to salvage the situation .  ^\n\nLee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing Eddie and Gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation .  ^\n\nHe enlists the help of Kiki ( Julia Roberts  )  , Gwen \'s   sister  , personal assistant and whipping girl .  ^\n\nWhat Lee does n\'t   know is that Kiki is in love with Eddie  , a fact that could temper her effectiveness .  ^\n\nPress junkets are a haven for control freaks .  ^\n\nStudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel  , with food and drink always at hand .  ^\n\nGenerally  , on the evening of their arrival  , writers are bussed to see the featured film  , then ferreted straight back to the hotel .  ^\n\nThe next day  , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews .  ^\n\nEvery 30 minutes or so  , a producer  , director  , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions  , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things .  ^\n\nThe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression  writers are free to ask what they want  , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question  , they may not be invited to future junkets .  ^\n\nRepresentatives from TV stations face even more restrictions .  ^\n\nThey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew  , with the studio filming the exchanges .  ^\n\nThe  \" reporters  \" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars  , but to play it safe  , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs .  ^\n\nPlacing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired  , but the screenplay undermines the conceit .  ^\n\nThe junket is moved from the handsome  , but highly confining  , Four Seasons Hotel to a plush resort near Las Vegas .  ^\n\nFor most of the film  , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds  , completely safe from the eyes of the press .  ^\n\nWhen they do deal with journalists  , the  \" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters  \" premise is de-clawed .  ^\n\nGwen and Eddie insult each other while the TV cameras roll  , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and  , at the screening of the movie  , everyone connected with the film goes nuts  , all without any repercussions .  ^\n\nLee certainly is n\'t   bothered by any of the infantile outbursts  ; in fact  , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids .  ^\n\nIs the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors  ?  ^\n\nHell no  they feel Lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie .  ^\n\nAll of which underscores how Billy Crystal and co-writer Peter Tolan screwed up their own premise  : The comedy in  \" America \'s   Sweethearts  \" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters  , except that it does n\'t   matter because any publicity is good publicity .  ^\n\nAnd thus the very set-up for the film implodes  , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter .  ^\n\nSo what about the cast  ?  ^\n\nJulia Roberts  , at her best playing the underdog  , is utterly charming here  , although I could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one  , by the way  ) .  ^\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones makes a believable brat and John Cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic .  ^\n\nBy casting himself as the publicist  , Billy Crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on  \" Comic Relief\"- stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks .  ^\n\nIn supporting roles  , Hank Azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a Spanish accent that Speedy Gonzales would have deemed  \" too broad .  \"  ^\n\nSeth Green is amusing as a toadie  , Stanley Tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and Christopher Walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair  , though he has little to work with .  ^\n\nCome to think of it  ,  \" little to work with  \" is the operative phrase for this movie .  ^\n\nAs a Hollywood satire  ,  \" America \'s   Sweethearts  \" is toothless .  ^\n\nAs a romance  , it is at best a minor pleasure .  ^\n\nSuch a good cast  , such a waste of their efforts .  ^\n\nHad it not been taken long ago  , a better title for the film would have been  \" Much Ado about Nothing .  \"    '
cv714_19704.txt,'Do the folks at Disney have no common decency  ?  ^\n\nThey have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects  , embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick .  ^\n\nWas n\'t   Mr. Magoo enough  , people  ?  ^\n\nObviously not .  ^\n\nInspector Gadget is not what I would call ideal family entertainment .  ^\n\nYounger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness  , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity .  ^\n\nThe movie is poorly edited  , grossly manipulative  , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle .  ^\n\nAll the elements are there  , but the manner in which director David Kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite .  ^\n\nAs a huge fan of the 80 \'s   animated TV show  , the first thing I must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain .  ^\n\nIn the cartoon  , Dr. Claw was a frightening  , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer .  ^\n\nWe never saw his face  ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair  , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat .  ^\n\nAs a child  , I always imagined what Dr. Claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years .  ^\n\nWith the release of the live-action movie  , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it \'s    ...  ^\n\nRupert Everett  ?  !  ^\n\nOnly now  , Dr. Claw is simply known as Claw ( ` One word  , \' he explains  , ` like Madonna \'  ) .  ^\n\nHe sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove  , and seems far less interesting than the animated version .  ^\n\nIt helps that the dashing Everett is enthusiastic  , but he overplays the role entirely too far .  ^\n\nWhen all is said and done  , this was n\'t   a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous Dr. Claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool .  ^\n\nHe does still have his cat  , though .  ^\n\nIn the title role  , Matthew Broderick looks lost .  ^\n\nThe actor  , while usually downright charming  , does n\'t   know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers .  ^\n\nBroderick first plays a friendly  , naive security guard named John Brown  , who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people .  ^\n\nHe has a mad crush on pretty scientist Brenda ( Joely Fisher  )  , who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics .  ^\n\nBut one fateful night  , her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire ( Everett  ) who wants to take over the world .  ^\n\nJohn courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime  , but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames .  ^\n\nIn a full body cast  , he is chosen to be the first human prototype for Brenda \'s   work  ; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys .  ^\n\nAnd so is born Inspector Gadget .  ^\n\nAs bad as this movie is  , it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes .  ^\n\nBroderick actually fares better playing Robo Gadget  , an evil and destructive clone that Claw has set loose on the city .  ^\n\nAnd there are about two or three amusing punch lines  , the funniest being when Robo Gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall  , and a Japanese man flees the scene while screaming  , ` This is why I left Tokyo  ! \'  ^\n\nAlas  , the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle .  ^\n\nThere are so many tired plot additions .  ^\n\nGadget \'s   talking car ( voiced by D.L. Hughley  ) is the same type of character as Zoot the suit from My Favorite Martian .  ^\n\nBoth are wisecracking  , non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children .  ^\n\nWell  , it just does n\'t   work ( in fact  , Zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this  ) .  ^\n\nAnd do n\'t   even get me started about the villains .  ^\n\nI did n\'t   mind Everett \'s   performance  , but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust .  ^\n\nThe characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles .  ^\n\nPenny ( Michelle Trachtenberg  ) and Brain the dog now have little to do with the action  , and Chief Quimby ( Dabney Coleman  ) has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action .  ^\n\nThe special effects are everywhere  , but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over .  ^\n\nThe problem here lies solely in the script .  ^\n\nPerhaps the next time Disney attempts a remake like this  , they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals .  ^\n\nHere is one critic crossing his fingers  , anyway .

cv725_10266.txt,'The first scene of OPERATION CONDOR has Jackie Chan preparing for a secret mission .   ^\n\nHe attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth  , but misses .   ^\n\nAfter they ricochet off his face  , he says  ,  \" Not a good start .  \"   ^\n\nAs it turns out  , this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence  , but to the rest of the movie as well .  ^\n\nIn this  , the latest of the Jackie Chan movies to be released in America after first runs in Hong Kong  , Chan plays an international operative codenamed  \" Condor  \"  , and is tasked by the United Nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the Nazi \'s   during their retreat across the Saharan desert during the Second World War .  ^\n\nFor some reason  , Condor is given his mission at the U.S. embassy in Spain .   ^\n\nI think this may have been done so that in a chase scene  , they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart .  ^\n\nWatch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country  , most notably in Europe .   ^\n\nThe chase will take itself through a marketplace  , and a fruit cart will be overturned .   ^\n\nIt \'s   almost a guarantee .   ^\n\nAnyway   ... .  ^\n\nCondor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden  ; the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it  , which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly .   ^\n\nTo help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly  , Condor is accompanied by a desert expert ( Carol Cheng  ) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold ( Eva Cobo  ) .   ^\n\nThere are n\'t   supposed to be any relatives of the Nazi captain living in Spain  , but Condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something .   ^\n\nAlthough these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission  , they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for Chan to jump into his martial arts .   ^\n\nIn fact  , most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight .  ^\n\nI suppose this is n\'t   so bad  , since Chan \'s   action is really the best part of the movie  , and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway .   ^\n\nIf you \'ve   never seen a Jackie Chan movie  , do n\'t   expect a great plot  , but do expect to be entertained by his moves .   ^\n\nThey are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human .   ^\n\nKnowing that he does his own stunts  , and knowing that this is the real stuff ( no computer-masked bungee cords here  ) makes the action sequences all the more exciting .   ^\n\nYou \'ve   got to hand it to a guy who \'s   probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art .  ^\n\nAlso of note in this  , as in any Jackie Chan movie  , is the humor .   ^\n\nAs far as I know  , none of his films take themselves too seriously  , and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about them .   ^\n\nWhat is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes .   ^\n\nUnlike a martial arts film such as anything with Jean Claude Van Damme  , where the fights get you on the visceral level  , fight scenes in Chan \'s   movies are simply entertaining .  ^\n\nYou marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , even Chan \'s   mastery ca n\'t   save this film .   ^\n\nThe plot and characters are so weak that they do n\'t   hold the movie together at all  , and the acting is terrible .   ^\n\nCarol Cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the Hong Kong Movie Awards in the past  , but since OPERATION CONDOR is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off .  ^\n\nThis  , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until I heard those kicks start flying .

cv728_17931.txt,'Back in 1980s  , Chuck Norris used to be synonym for the action films .  ^\n\nHe could n\'t    , of course  , top the success and fame of big action names like Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger  , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot\'em up and beat\'em up genre aficionados .  ^\n\nThat quantity was mostly provided by Cannon Group  , prolific production company that dominated the B-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap  , formulaic and  , more often than not  , unwatchable genre products .  ^\n\nTHE HITMAN  , 1991 action thriller directed by Chuck \'s   brother Aaron  , is one of the last among them .  ^\n\nChuck Norris here plays Seattle cop betrayed  , shot and left for dead by his partner ( which should n\'t   surprise anyone  , considering the fact that the partner is being played by Michael Parks  , specialised for roles of usually very mean characters  ) .  ^\n\nSurviving the shooting  , cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent .  ^\n\nHe infiltrates the underworld circles in Seattle and becomes their top hitman  , using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations - Italians  , French Canadians and Iranians .  ^\n\nSince it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from Chuck Norris  , at least not in this kind of movie  , the biggest attraction of this film should have been action .  ^\n\nWell  , the action in this film falls flat - it is boring  , repetitive and not at all exciting .  ^\n\nIt is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films .  ^\n\nWe know very little about Norris  \' character while  , on the other hand  , gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension .  ^\n\nIn the end we almost feel sorry for them  , since they are shown totally powerless against Norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade .  ^\n\nDuring the film  , somebody obviously became aware of that problem  , so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by Norris .  ^\n\nThat caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation .  ^\n\nThe photography in this film is dark  , setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it .

cv734_22821.txt,'I can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of Oliver Stone\'s    `Any Given Sunday\'.^\n\nIt \'s  an entertaining movie that offers both insight and    excitement  into  the  rock-em ,  sock-em  profession  of pro football .   ^\n\nUnfortunately , the director seems to have only one priority on his mind :    sprucing  up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers .^\n\nIn    altering each frame with quick-flash photography and dizzying , in-your-face    editing , Stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible    character development and football politics .^\n\nWe see glimpses of greatness ,    but  `Any  Given  Sunday\'  has  its  agenda  all  tangled in technical    gobbledy-gook .^\n\nIt grows tiresome and monotonous .^\n\nYes , Stone has pulled a    Brian DePalma .    ^\n\nMatters of importance are pushed aside right from the get-go .^\n\nTony D\'Amato    ( Al Pacino ) , coach of the struggling Miami Sharks , finds his team stuck in a    losing rut .^\n\nAging Quarterback Cap Rooney ( Dennis Quaid ) appears to be losing    his touch , and D\'Amato ca n\'t  seem to ignite any passion in his squad .^\n\nWhen    Cap is injured on the field , and after a patch of unlikely events occur ,    third-string QB Willie Beaman ( Jamie Foxx ) is brought into the game .^\n\nOnce in    the huddle ( and this becomes an in-game ritual ) , Beaman horks all over the    field .^\n\nNerves , you see .^\n\nEventually though , the ancy youngster wins the game    for his teammates , sparking his rise to fame in the football world - the    endorsements ,  the music videos , etc. - and Stone straps us in for the    jolting ride of behind-the-scenes stress and fury that the business is    apparently like .^\n\nAnd I believe it .^\n\nThere is some intriguing insight posed ,    but in the big scheme of things , Stone fumbles the ball .    ^\n\nThe problem with the director \'s  visual approach is this : he uses extravagant    editing  devices  when  a  more  conventional approach would have been    appropriate .^\n\nFootball is an exciting game to watch , but Stone seems to think    dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the    adrenaline rush .^\n\nI guess he is mistaken. `Any Given Sunday\' is a visual    kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently    than it excites them .^\n\nMany football fans ( including one I attended with ) are    liable to be disappointed with the `ultra-stylish\' way Stone has decided to    present the game .    ^\n\nIn return , a three-star film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the    director \'s  tampering .^\n\nIn welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a    break , this actually shows decent character development and interaction .^\n\nFor    instance , heated returns between D\'Amato and feisty young owner Christina    Pagniacci ( Cameron Diaz ) are enjoyable to watch .^\n\nThere is also a solid    performance from Jamie Foxx , who experiments with great success in his first    trek into dramatic territory .^\n\nThe stellar supporting cast includes Matthew    Modine , Aaron Eckhart , Lauren Holly , Ann-Margret and Charlton Heston ( in an    extraordinarily brief appearance ) .^\n\nUnfortunately , too many big names are    wasted - a typical demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast .    ^\n\nPacino makes some interesting progress with his character .^\n\nYou begin to    identify with coach D\'Amato and the morals he is striving for  .... but I    often felt he was just another play thing Stone could weave in and out of    his editing dynamics. `Any Given Sunday\' is a watchable but disappointing    sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat to excessive    filmmaking technique .^\n\nAnd a very distant back seat , at that .

Ron  Hubbard \'s  sci-fi novel ?^\n\nEarly previews for    \" Battlefield Earth , \" with constant shots of a makeup-laden Travolta cackling    like Lex Luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , \" What the    hell is Travolta thinking ? \"^\n\nThe movie did nothing to stem such remarks .^\n\nAll    that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : Terl    cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other Psychlo .^\n\nOf course ,    this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the    script  clumsily  stumbles into political commentary .^\n\nThe Psychlos are    probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate America , but CEOs    generally  do n\'t   laugh  maniacally  after denying pay raises to their    employees . ^\n\n( \" You  were  going  to  be promoted --  but now you \'re  not !   ^\n\nFwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! \" )    ^\n\nIt \'s  no big surprise Terl loses to the humans --  he \'s  an idiot .^\n\nHe breaks    every kind of supervillain rule in the book .^\n\nHe underestimates his enemies ,    assuming he \'ll  win just because he \'s  smarter .^\n\n( He uses the word \" leverage \"    like some sort of Scientologist mantra . )^\n\nNot content to go the James Bond    villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a    machine  that  gives  him  knowledge of all the Psychlos \' language and    technology .^\n\n( Why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond    me . )^\n\nHe then appears shocked that Johnny points a gun at him .^\n\nNo wonder this    guy never got his promotion .    ^\n\nThe plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention .^\n\nWhy do the Psychlos    build an Earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little    breathing apparatuses to survive ?^\n\nHow come the Psychlos are wasting their    time mining for gold when the doors of Fort Knox are wide open ?^\n\nHow in the    world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1,000    years ?^\n\nAnd how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them    so  quickly ? ^\n\nThere \'s   a whole lot more to scratch one \'s  head about in    \" Battlefield Earth . \"^\n\nBring a scorecard to track the plot holes .    ^\n\nDirector Roger Christian shoots \" Battlefield Earth \" in the most distracting    way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason .   ^\n\nAll the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it \'s  awfully    difficult  to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch    ordinary passages of dialogue .^\n\nThe action sequences are atrociously edited ,    every  one  turned  into an endless slow-motion parade that drains all    potential excitement .^\n\nAre these things really so hard to construct ?^\n\nMy    respect for supposed \" lightweight \" action directors has grown by leaps and    bounds after witnessing in \" Battlefield Earth \" how badly an action sequence    can be shot .    ^\n\nThis movie is an absolute headache .^\n\nIt \'s  not just the shot selection and    editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense .^\n\nFor most of \" Battlefield    Earth \'s  \" running time , I just did n\'t  know what was happening .^\n\nIt did n\'t  have    anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they    certainly are ) --  I really had no idea what the hell was going on .^\n\nWhen I    pieced the plot together later , it did n\'t  look any better .^\n\nHere \'s  how much    of a disaster this is : \" Battlefield Earth \" is already the worst movie of the    year , and it \'s  going to take something really , really inept to top it .^\n\nThe    only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be    suckered into joining the Church of Scientology because of it .^\n\nIn fact , I \'d     think that Hubbard \'s  cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb    as fast as possible .    ^\n\nThat \'ll  teach me to give into Bad Movie Syndrome again .    ^\n\n'

cv738_10287.txt,'Well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you .  ^\n\nBecause thats all that there really is   ... .  ^\n\nI found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the Plot .  ^\n\nFor one thing  , a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity   ... .  ^\n\nI am not saying that this is n\'t   possible.. but it does leave one to wonder  ...^\n\nI know I did .  ^\n\nAnother thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out   .... and certain Scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations .  ^\n\nThere was one scene that should have been short   ... but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it I found myself thinking. .  ^\n\nOK enough already get on with it .  ^\n\nThere are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do   ... things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort   ... another thing that I noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning .  ^\n\nThis movie is also very predictable   ... you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment.. granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you .  ^\n\nAlso some of the things that happen are a little TOO predictable and several cliques are repeated   ...  ^\n\nIt gets boring at times to tell you the truth   ... even though there is still action going on .  ^\n\nAnother little point I might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some Shoot them up type of Hero .  ^\n\nSome of the characters are not proper for their roles .  ^\n\nThe acting is fine but the characters just do n\'t   seem to add up .  ^\n\nIf I was to base my review totally on the plot then I would n\'t   rate this movie too highly         But that \'s   just the thing this movie is n\'t   just the plot  , its the whole package and this package is really well done .  ^\n\nThe whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie .  ^\n\nThe special effects are just amazing  , you ca n\'t   tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live  , in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just would n\'t   be able to say that the creature was n\'t   there during filming  , extinct or not .  ^\n\nAnother thing is the Destruction scenes   ...  ^\n\nWOW  , those were masterpieces.. well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the Dino \'s   make this one of the reasons to see this movie .  ^\n\nThis movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office.. unfortunately it will take away from Fifth element but alas what can we do. .  ^\n\nI may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments.. go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me .          ^\n\nOne Little side note  , although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in Toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid  , there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock I think that some people really want money badly   .... and I think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance   .... you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made   .... .  ^\n\nI thought I \'d   put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick   ... its not that bad a movie but its not THAT great either hope you people realize this .

cv739_12179.txt,'When a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy  , the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass .   ^\n\nToss out your usual objectivity  , ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it  , forget how unbearable it was to sit through  , and find some meaningless way to compliment it .   ^\n\nThis  , of course  , will be of no service to your readers  , but at least you \'ll   avoid the hate mail from the movie \'s   fans .       ^\n\nThus it is with a heavy heart that I review the movie PAULINA ( not to be confused with the recent movie PAULIE about a talking parrot  ) .  ^\n\nDirected by Vicky Funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of Paulina Cruz Suarez .   ^\n\nPaulina was a maid in Vicky \'s   household when Vicky was young .       ^\n\nI got to learn the film \'s   background when I attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present .   ^\n\nFor those without such context  , the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film .   ^\n\nThe acting is amateurish  , the story is maudlin  , and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie .   ^\n\nGrainy and overexposed  , the movie  , shot on 16mm film and videotape  , has little to recommend it .  ^\n\nConfusingly composed  , the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story .       ^\n\nQuite bloody at times  , the story  , full of horrific images  , seems designed to shock and repulse us .   ^\n\nWhy else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8-year-old Paulina  ?       ^\n\nAnother scene has a teenage Paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her .   ^\n\nIn retaliation  , she bites off part of his finger .   ^\n\nThis covers the both of them in a bucket of blood .   ^\n\nThe passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner .   ^\n\nOne  , for example  , sees her as an Aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body .       ^\n\nThe lugubrious tale has Paulina being raped and beaten .   ^\n\nCertainly she had to endure a miserable life .   ^\n\nBut that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good .   ^\n\nI felt trapped in the theater watching it .   ^\n\nOnly the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable .       ^\n\nPAULINA runs 1:28 .   ^\n\nThe film is in Spanish with English subtitles .  ^\n\nIt is not rated but would be an R for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers  .'
cv740_13643.txt,'In this year \'s   summer movie preview issue of _Entertainment_Weekly_  , Theresa Connelly described her writing-directing debut  , _Polish_Wedding_  , as  \" a child that did not quite become the child I thought it would .  \"   ^\n\nOne wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film  , a comedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements .  ^\n\nThe family at the center of _Polish_Wedding_ is the Pzoniaks  , which consists of mother Jadzia ( Lena Olin  )  , father Bolek ( Gabriel Byrne  )  , sole daughter Hala ( Claire Danes  ) and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness .   ^\n\nIt \'s   a large family  , but there \'s   not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch  , certainly not in the primary trio .   ^\n\nJadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family  , but she \'s   kind of a hypocrite since she \'s   carrying on an affair with a businessman Rade Serbedzija  ) .   ^\n\nHer excuse for her affair is neglect from Bolek  , who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration .   ^\n\nAlso  , how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy  , sexy Jadzia  ?   ^\n\nHala is a spoiled  , self-centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy .  ^\n\nWith such an unappealing set of characters  , it \'s   no surprise that _Polish_Wedding_\'s   plot complications are far from involving .   ^\n\nNaturally  , Jadzia and Bolek would like Hala to marry the young cop  , Russell Schuster ( Adam Trese  )  , who fathered the child  , but he refuses to make such a commitment .   ^\n\nHo-hum .   ^\n\nAnother complication  , involving the decidedly un-virginal Hala being selected to crown a statue of the Virgin Mary  , is first played for laughs and then  , inexplicably  , as a Profound Statement in the film \'s   climax --  which  , ironically  , is funnier than any of the film \'s   lame attempts at humor  , such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where Jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up Russell .  ^\n\nThat scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by Connelly .   ^\n\nThe Jadzia-Bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers .   ^\n\nThe Hala-Russell conflict is n\'t   resolved in as contrived a manner  , but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something .   ^\n\nAnd then there \'s   some atrocious dialogue  , which I am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound  :  \" Look at all these pickles .   ^\n\nJust looking at them gives me such great sadness .  \"  ^\n\nAs misguided as _Polish_Wedding_ is  , the affair is something of a letdown  , considering the strong performances by Byrne  , Danes  , and especially the fiery Olin .   ^\n\nThey obviously believed in Connelly and her material --  a faith that audiences will be hard-pressed to share .

cv741_12765.txt,'Several days after having seen this movie  , I \'m   still trying to  determine what director Christopher Guest  , a man whose sense of humor I  usually appreciate  , found funny in either the concept or the execution  of ALMOST HEROES .   ^\n\nThis is a dreadful motion picture  a lowbrow example  of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an  exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio .   ^\n\nThere \'s   a kind of desperation  in the movie \'s   approach to humor that reveals the film makers  \'  uncertainty about how entertaining the material is  ; the manic style  betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed  script .       ^\n\nThe premise does n\'t   sound especially amusing to begin with  ALMOST  HEROES tells the tale of two explorers  , the effeminate Leslie Edwards  ( Matthew Perry  ) and the uncouth Bartholomew Hunt ( Chris Farley  )  , who are  racing Lewis and Clark on the trip to the American Northwest .   ^\n\nEdwards  and Hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies  ( albeit of the early-19th century variety  )  , including a Frenchman named  Guy Fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none of which  prove to be useful  )  , a pretty Indian maiden who turns into the  obligatory love interest  , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of  debilitating injuries .   ^\n\nAlong the way  , the intrepid explorers encounter  bears  , bald eagles  , aging Native American warriors  , and a conquistador  named Hildago ( Kevin Dunn  ) who raves about his beautiful hair .   ^\n\nThe  explorers  \' trek takes them through forests  , across the snow-capped Rocky  Mountains  , and over a waterfall .         ^\n\nThis setup leads to a lot of shouting  , a great deal of lunacy  , and  very few laughs .   ^\n\nFarley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and  bellowing  , but  , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with  an eagle  , his heart does n\'t   seem to be in it .   ^\n\nMatthew Perry  , one of the  stars of TV \'s   FRIENDS ( who had some modest success in the romantic  comedy  , FOOLS RUSH IN  ) is badly miscast .   ^\n\nAs a foil for Farley and an  antidote to his runaway energy  , Perry lacks the necessary edge of the  proverbial straight man .   ^\n\nI \'m   not a big fan of David Spade  , and I did n\'t    like TOMMY BOY  , but at least he and Farley worked well together .   ^\n\nAs far  as the supporting players go  , none of them makes more than a fleeting  impression .   ^\n\nEugene Levy is wasted  , and Kevin Dunn is about as  interesting here as he is in GODZILLA .       ^\n\nFrankly  , it \'s   a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly  come from Christopher Guest  , the brilliant comic force behind such films  as THIS IS SPINAL TAP  , THE BIG PICTURE  , and WAITING FOR GUFFMAN .    ^\n\nAlthough Guest gets the costumes right  , this nearly-inconsequential  success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution .   ^\n\nThe  special effects  , such as they are  , are execrable .   ^\n\nFor an example of  some really poor blue screen work  , look at the scenes where the  characters are shooting the rapids ( they \'re   obviously getting buckets of  water thrown on them  ) and where Farley is being carried off by an eagle .       ^\n\nEven though Farley did n\'t   have the most stellar of acting careers  ,  he does n\'t   deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by ALMOST  HEROES .   ^\n\nWhile some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a  few guffaws from 12-year old boys  , the level of comedy in ALMOST HEROES  falls far below the level of sophomoric .   ^\n\nFarley fans who see this film  as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty  , since it  takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this  cinematic torture session .

Linz  ( ONE FINE DAY  )  , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal  cuteness .   ^\n\nHe \'s   not half as interesting as Macaulay Culkin once was .    ^\n\nThe villains  , pale copies of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern  , are even less  engaging than the pair of idiots in FLUBBER .   ^\n\nIn HOME ALONE 3  , there are  four of them ( Olek Krupa  , David Thornton  , Lenny von Dohlen  , and Rya  Kihlstedt  )  , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many  pratfalls .       ^\n\nThis time  , the kid is n\'t   left home alone because his parents have  gone on a trip .   ^\n\nInstead  , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox  , so  he ca n\'t   go to school .   ^\n\nHis dad ( Kevin Kilner  ) is away on business and  his mom ( Haviland Morris  ) has to run errands  , so  , for the most part  ,  he \'s   all by himself during the day .   ^\n\nThrough a series of coincidences  too irritating to relate  , a top secret U.S. Air Force integrated circuit  comes into his possession .   ^\n\nIt \'s   wanted by a gang of four international  crooks who intend to break into Alex \'s   home to retrieve it .   ^\n\nThe eight- year old  , who is wise beyond his years  , booby traps the house with all  sorts of Rube Goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and  incapacitate the villains .       ^\n\nThe movie \'s   climax takes place during a raging snowstorm  only  none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable .   ^\n\nPreviously  , the  most counterfeit-looking snow effects I can remember were in STAR TREK  III .   ^\n\nThese are far worse .   ^\n\nIn fact  , the production values are so shoddy  that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a  shining sun can be seen .   ^\n\nIf IT \'S   A WONDERFUL LIFE could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s  , why ca n\'t   HOME ALONE 3  , which has a  significantly larger budget and \' 90s technology at its disposal  ?       ^\n\nThere has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of  live-action cartoon violence for young children .   ^\n\nHOME ALONE 3 will add  fuel to the fire .   ^\n\nIt \'s   one thing to see Wyle E. Coyote flattened by a  10 ton Acme weight  , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall  on Lenny von Dohlen .   ^\n\nAdults and even older children will recognize that  this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous  , but what about five  and six-year olds  ?   ^\n\nThe level of violence in HOME ALONE 3 is extreme   many of Alex \'s   schemes are nasty enough to kill .   ^\n\nBut  , because this is a   \" family film  ,  \" no one dies  , despite being electrocuted  , falling thirty  feet  , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell .         ^\n\nNot only is HOME ALONE 3 unnecessary  , but it \'s   offensive .   ^\n\nIt \'s   an  exercise in tediousness  , and there is n\'t   a genuine laugh to be found  from the beginning to the end ( unless  , by some strange quirk of fate  ,  you have missed every 1990s movie associated with John Hughes  , and thus  have n\'t   seen this stuff before  ) .   ^\n\nI ca n\'t   imagine anyone with a  reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this  pointless adventure .   ^\n\nMaybe that \'s   why the only ones laughing at the  screening I attended were still in their thumb-sucking years .

cv745_14009.txt,'The Avengers  ^\n\nConventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children \'s   items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made .  ^\n\nThat \'s   when the kids of that time have jobs  , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives .  ^\n\nCheck out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you \'ll   find that Yogi Bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks .  ^\n\nThere \'s   a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and

secret agent John Steed ( then-Patrick Macnee  ) and his third partner  , Emma Peel ( then-Diana Rigg  ) are the pair that the American audience fell for .  ^\n\nSurrealistic and witty  , the series fit the mood of the times .  ^\n\nThe leather-clad Rigg probably did n\'t   hurt the ratings either .  ^\n\nAfter all it \'s   not a coincidence that you ca n\'t   pronounce her character \'s   name without  \" appeal  \" .  ^\n\nNow we \'re   in the nineties .  ^\n\nSteed ( now-Ralph Fiennes  ) and Peel ( now-Uma Thurman  ) are battling evil genius Sir August De Wynter ( Sean Connery  ) who is screwing with England \'s   weather .  ^\n\nThat \'s   about as much of a plot as we have .  ^\n\nThere \'s   some footage about a lot of other things that either do n\'t   make sense or make even less sense .  ^\n\nWe get betrayal for some unknown reason .  ^\n\nEvil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film .  ^\n\nRemarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason .  ^\n\nThere \'s   a high tech hot air balloon  , but I have no idea why anyone \'s   in it .  ^\n\nThe spy agency is run by a man called  \" Mother  \" who is in a wheelchair and a woman named  \" Father  \" who is blind  ... at least in some scenes .  ^\n\nThere \'s   probably a reason for all of this  , but we \'ll   never know it .  ^\n\nMacnee makes an appearance of sorts .  ^\n\nHe is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing .  ^\n\nA group of villains sits around a table  , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits .  ^\n\nAt first it \'s   humorous to watch the teddies waddle around  , but then it becomes goofy .  ^\n\nThe movie is a medley of clutter  , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner .  ^\n\nIt feels like major portions of the film are missing .  ^\n\nThe storyline jumps rather than flows .  ^\n\nReportedly the film was re-cut several times .  ^\n\nThis is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing .  ^\n\nThere \'s   one good point where Peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by Escher .  ^\n\nOther than that  , the effects are second-rate .  ^\n\nThe weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes .  ^\n\nThurman almost makes an adequate Emma Peel but it does n\'t   work .  ^\n\nShe looks good  , dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there \'s   no spark .  ^\n\nFiennes fares even less well .  ^\n\nMacnee \'s   Steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor .  ^\n\nFiennes  \' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who has never been out of his home town .  ^\n\nEven

utmost effort  , you were able to care about any of it  , the scenes are bewildering .  ^\n\nThe primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads .  ^\n\nWitty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination .  ^\n\nAdmittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film  , but there \'s   no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever .  ^\n\nOne of Emma Peel \'s   first lines of dialog is  \" Rules are made to be broken .  \"  ^\n\nIt does n\'t   get any better .  ^\n\nAdvance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone .  ^\n\nThe release date was changed several times .  ^\n\nConnery refuses to promote the film .  ^\n\nThere was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for Warner Brothers .  ^\n\nAt least this way  , they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out .  ^\n\nAdmittedly I have n\'t   seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades .  ^\n\nMy guess is that it would be severely dated now .  ^\n\nNo matter how antiquated it might be  , there \'s   no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing .  ^\n\nThere \'s

cv746_10471.txt,'A bit of a throw-together assembled by MCA TV Special Projects for cable television .   ^\n\nIt was disowned by director David Lynch but it \'s    considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline .   ^\n\nQuality dubs of this version from the out-of-print Japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the World Wide Web.  ***THE REVIEW*** Released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $ 40 million  , the film of Frank Herbert \'s   cult novel DUNE was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans .   ^\n\nDirector David Lynch ( BLUE VELVET  , ERASERHEAD  , TWIN PEAKS  ) was working on his biggest production to date  , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in Mexico .   ^\n\nThe screenplay was Lynch \'s   own  , chosen after the script submitted by original author Herbert was rejected .  ^\n\nDUNE is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of Emperors .   ^\n\nThe key to cosmic power is the planet Arrakis ( Dune  )  , a windswept desert planet that \'s   home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange .   ^\n\nThe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe .   ^\n\nIt extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it .   ^\n\nMost importantly  , it allows the navigators of the Spacing Guild ( once human but now hideously mutated  ) to  \" fold space  \" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously  , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish .  ^\n\nLynch \'s   film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story \'s   two main strands .   ^\n\nOne is the long-standing rivalry between two families  , Houses Atreides and House Harkonnen  , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on Arrakis .   ^\n\nThe second strand is the emergence of young Paul Atreides as the reluctant Messiah long-awaited by the natives of Arrakis  , the Fremen .   ^\n\nThe deeply religious Fremen want control over their homeworld  , and young Paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film  , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what Lynch originally intended .   ^\n\nThe thinking among Universal \'s   oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office .   ^\n\nWith Lynch \'s   initial cut running at closer to three or more hours  , the studio demanded that further cuts be made .  ^\n\nWhat a great idea  !   ^\n\nWhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible  ?  ^\n\nThe most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative  , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters .   ^\n\nThus their personalities are vague  , their motivations unclear and  , in the case of Paul \'s   father Duke Leto  , their demise rather meaningless .   ^\n\nThe end result is a distinct chill  : we ca n\'t   warm to most of the cast and we do n\'t   care much for them .   ^\n\nAnd it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the Dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book .   ^\n\nDUNE is also a very serous film .   ^\n\nThe constant  \" self-talk  \" by various characters makes it SO serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment .   ^\n\nThe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them .   ^\n\nHumour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the Harkonnen \'s   mad  , sadistic kind - is hard to find .   ^\n\nYou may balk at the comparison  , but as a writer Lynch could well have done with some lessons from George Lucus  \' STAR WARS trilogy .  ^\n\nThe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster  , however .   ^\n\nIt still possesses enough of Lynch \'s   stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi .   ^\n\nSpecial effects whiz Carlo Rambaldi \'s   giant sandworms are an awesome sight .   ^\n\nBoth the production design ( Anthony Masters  ) and costume design ( Bob Ringwood  ) are striking and original .   ^\n\nAnd the magnificent score by Toto and Brian Eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years .   ^\n\nWith these elements in place and the benefit of Freddie Francis  \' lush cinematography  , the film is at least a feast for the senses .   ^\n\nSee it in the widescreen format if you can .  ^\n\nAnd despite all the cuts  , several cast members still make a strong impression  , most notably Kenneth McMillan as the supremely nasty Baron Vladimir Harkonnen .   ^\n\nSian Phillips also registers strongly as the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam  , leader of the Bene Gesserit religious order who \'s   secret aim is to manipulate Paul \'s   destiny for its own shadowy ends .   ^\n\nAs Paul Atreides  , the young Kyle MacLachlan starts off somewhat shakily  , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the Fremen crusade .  ^\n\nThe conclusion  ?   ^\n\nAny assessment of this film must take into account that Frank Herbert \'s   original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker .   ^\n\nDavid Lynch took a brave stab at it and  , partly due to forces beyond his control  , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects .   ^\n\nDUNE certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release .   ^\n\nMany chose to stay away altogether  , as the film \'s   disastrous box office showing attests .  ^\n\nThe extended version  , however  , is a rather different beast .   ^\n\nIn 1984 Lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition  \" director \'s   cut  \" of the film on home video  , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres .   ^\n\nBut  , alas  , he failed to do so  , choosing to move on to other projects .   ^\n\nIn a way  , then  , it is partly Lynch \'s   own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version  , put together in 1988 by MCA TV Special Projects for airing on cable networks in the USA .  ^\n\nStung into action  , Lynch successfully petitioned the Director \'s   Guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with  \" Allen Smithee  \"  , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work .   ^\n\nHe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous  \" Judas Booth  \" .  ^\n\nCertainly  , looking at the results of MCA \'s   handiwork there \'s   at least half a dozen instances that  , for sheer technical sloppiness  , are good enough reasons for the director to object .   ^\n\nBut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of DUNE offers in several crucial areas .  ^\n\nMost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration  , both of which fill many holes in the original version \'s   storyline .   ^\n\nPaul \'s   relationship with his father and associates is more intimate  , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously .   ^\n\nThe political skulduggery involving the Emperor  , the Spacing Guild  , the Bene Gesserits and the two warring Houses is far better explained .   ^\n\nPaul \'s   initiation into the Fremen way of life on Arrakis is also fleshed out considerably .   ^\n\nAnd as further background  , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the Dune universe .  ^\n\nAs a piece of storytelling  , then  , MCA TV \'s   version of DUNE is clearly superior .  ^\n\nAs a piece of editing  , however  , it is at times surprisingly inept .   ^\n\nThe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough  , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate .   ^\n\nThere \'s   some sloppy cutting  , too  , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order .   ^\n\nAnd the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg. ships coming and going  , soldiers coming and going  ) is at times clearly out-of-context .   ^\n\nThis is the kind of thing to which Lynch objected  , and rightly so .  ^\n\nIt should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of U.S. television .   ^\n\nBut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from Lynch that was n\'t   even in Herbert \'s   book .   ^\n\nThe scene features Baron Harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his  \" heart plug  \" .   ^\n\nIts a surreal and disturbing episode that \'s   very Lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know  : the Baron is a nasty piece of work .  ^\n\nDespite its own peculiar flaws  , then  , the extended version of DUNE is a generally superior film .   ^\n\nAll up  , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered  , fabricated or newly created sequences .   ^\n\nUnless the idiosyncratic Lynch has a sudden change of heart  , the  \" Alan Smithee  \" version remains the closest we \'ll   get to what the movie should have been .   ^\n\nOn repeated viewings  , one suspects it is closer than what Lynch would be prepared to admit .  ^\n\nStill  , as one of this century \'s   great science-fiction novels  , some fans and perhaps the late Herbert himself would argue that DUNE deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen .   ^\n\nWith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company New Amsterdam Entertainment in 1998  , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the Dune saga  .'
cv747_18189.txt,'In 1970s  , many European intellectuals  , especially those on the left political hemisphere  , became obsessed with the rise of Fascism .  ^\n\nWhich was n\'t   so hard to expect  , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies .  ^\n\nIn such times  , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion  , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war Europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist Italy and Nazi Germany .  ^\n\nOf course  , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other  , less noble reasons .  ^\n\nFor them  , moral depravity of Fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era .  ^\n\nWhich  , naturally  , made some of those films very popular among teen audience .  ^\n\nOne of such filmmakers was Italian director Tinto Brass  , who later made career shooting expensive  , stylish soft porn .  ^\n\nSALON KITTY  , his 1976 film  , is very losely based on the novel by Peter Nordern  , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of WW2 .  ^\n\nIn 1939  , Walter Schellenberg  , one of the heads of Nazi intelligence service has set up the elite  , exclusive brothel in Berlin with clientele comprised of top Nazi officials and foreign diplomats .  ^\n\nNone of the customers knew that the girls were all Nazi agents  , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged .  ^\n\nThe most bizarre thing is the fact that not even Kitty  , nominal madame of the brothel  , did n\'t   know the real purpose of that enterprise .  ^\n\nScreenplay by Tinto Brass  , of course  , simplifies the story and changes few names .  ^\n\nSchellenberg is now Wallenberg ( Helmut Berger  )  , ambitious Nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top .  ^\n\nKitty Kellerman ( Ingrid Thulin  )  , apart from being madam  , has a second job as a cabaret singer .  ^\n\nCaught in the net of depravity is sweet  , innocent girl Margerithe ( Theresa Ann Savoy  ) thrown into brothel .  ^\n\nThere she falls in love with customer Hans Reiter ( Bekim Fehmiu  )  , disenchanted pilot of Luftwaffe .  ^\n\nWhen Margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel  , she finds out that the place is bugged .  ^\n\nShe informs the madam of the real situation  , and both women decide to confront Wallenberg .  ^\n\nThose who tend to bash Benigni for exploiting Holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film  , that uses the darkest pages of European history for cheap sexploitation .  ^\n\nBut  , although SALON KITTY does n\'t   happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful  ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing  )  , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples Wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by Kitty .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , Brass seems to overuse other cinematical references  , probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of Berger and Thulin in Luchino Visconti \'s   THE DAMNED  , but the most noticeable and irritating is Ingrid Thulin \'s   unsuccessful attempt to imitate Lisa Minelli \'s   musical numbers from CABARET .  ^\n\nAll in all  , SALON KITTY is failure  , although with some very interesting moments .

cv749_18960.txt,'The General \'s   Daughter is a heartless  , absurd film  , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters .   ^\n\nDirector Simon West treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity  , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth .   ^\n\nWhat \'s   worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic --   the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm .  ^\n\nJohn Travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess  , playing Warrant Officer Paul Brenner  ; Brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of Captain Elizabeth Campbell ( Leslie Stefanson  )  , daughter of General Joe Campbell ( James Cromwell  ) .   ^\n\nBrenner is teamed up with ex-spouse Sarah Sunderland ( Madeline Stowe  )  , and they check out all the suspects on the base  , including Elizabeth \'s   mentor  , Colonel Moore ( James Woods  ) .   ^\n\nSoon  , it becomes apparent that Elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff  , but the question comes down to why --   and  , of course  , who .    ^\n\nEbert \'s   Law of the Economy of Characters can be applied here  ; one interesting thing I noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists  )  , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story .   ^\n\nPerhaps I should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that  , but it \'s   painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something .   ^\n\nOn a story level  , The General \'s   Daughter is ineptly constructed .   ^\n\nThe film  , adapted by Christopher Bertolini and William Goldman from Nelson DeMille \'s   novel ( which was apparently based on a true story  )  , plods along to its conclusion  , filling in the blanks with stale  , unrealistic dialogue and  \" shocking  \" plot developments .  ^\n\nHaving not read the novel  , it \'s   difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author  , but I suppose they all are guilty to some degree .   ^\n\nScene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity  ; minutes after finding the dead young woman  , Brenner and Sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue  , which includes endless strings of forced lines .   ^\n\n( Sunderland actually asks Brenner  ,  \" Why was she killed  ?  \" to which I would have answered  ,  \" If I knew  , then the movie would already be over .  \"  )   ^\n\nOnly after we \'ve   spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together  ; this angle  , though apparently present to develop their characters  , is never explored .  ^\n\nNot that it really matters  , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot .   ^\n\nIn one scene  , Sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask .   ^\n\nShe sees one of his rings  , and she and Brenner find the man later that day based on the ring .   ^\n\nInstead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect  , they take him to Brenner \'s   houseboat  , beat him up  , and pour hot coffee in his lap .   ^\n\nThis scene really pushed me over the edge  , not because it \'s   gratuitous and mean-spirited  , but because it illustrates the film \'s   complete disregard for the characters and the audience .   ^\n\nIt was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene  , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise .   ^\n\nI realized that these constructs on screen are n\'t   actually characters  , but devices present only to serve the story .  ^\n\nThis would have been bad enough without the West \'s   need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct .   ^\n\nCompelling films about sexual crimes do n\'t   spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks  , and they certainly do n\'t   show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture .   ^\n\nThese scenes are not the least bit powerful  ; on the contrary  , they \'re   intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain  , whomever that may turn out to be .   ^\n\nIn addition  , the movie treats sexual fetishes --   and sadomasochism in particular --   as if it \'s   a perversion of everything we know to be pure .   ^\n\nThis standpoint is certainly allowed  , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up .   ^\n\nAs it is  , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes  , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane .  ^\n\nPerhaps the only positive elements in The General \'s   Daughter are a couple of the performances .   ^\n\nJames Woods has a few terrific scenes  , and plays his role with sharp  , witty subtlety .   ^\n\nI also liked James Cromwell  , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of West to make him villainous .   ^\n\nNonetheless  , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary  , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization .   ^\n\nThe General \'s   Daughter is the worst kind of Hollywood film --   it pretends to have a soul  , to be of strict moral code  , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments .

Ron Hubbard  , Battlefield Earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information .   ^\n\nIt \'s   the year 3000  , and an alien race called the Psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of Mexican wrestlers  ) conquered our planet in nine minutes .   ^\n\nOk  , we are all of 10 seconds in and I have a zillion questions racing through my mind .   ^\n\nWhen were we conquered  ?   ^\n\nThe audience is led to believe that this happened about 1,000 years earlier  , and if that is the case then we \'re   going to get into a whole BUNCH of problems later ( trust me   ... keep reading  ) .   ^\n\nAlso  , why do n\'t   we get to see Earth get conquered  ?   ^\n\nHow the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film  ?   ^\n\nHumans now live as cavemen or slave labor  , and for the film \'s   first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of Denver  , Colorado .   ^\n\nThey grunt and groan and babble about monsters .   ^\n\nSo  , when the Psychlos conquered Earth  , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills  ?   ^\n\nNone of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was  ) .   ^\n\nThis is definitely NOT the way to start an action/sci-fi film .   ^\n\nOne of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster  , and he begins to fight it .   ^\n\nThe  \" monster  \" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course .   ^\n\nHe turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course  , with some shrubs growing over them .   ^\n\nSo  , in 1,000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time  , with only a few weeds growing over it  ?   ^\n\nAnyway  , some of the humans are captured by the Psychlos led by Terl ( John Travolta  ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit .   ^\n\nThe cavemen ( led by Barry Pepper  ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever  , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet  , or something .   ^\n\nSo these cavemen are able to do what Earth failed to do 1,000 years earlier  ?   ^\n\nAnd  , we \'re   supposed to believe that Earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who ca n\'t   even handle a few cavemen  ?   ^\n\nOne of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned Air Force jets and using them to fight the Psychlos .   ^\n\nSo jets left unattended for 1,000 years are still able to fly  ?   ^\n\nPlease  , if I leave my car unattended for two weeks I have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood .   ^\n\nWhy did the Psychlos leave jets around anyway  ?   ^\n\nShould n\'t   they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us  ?   ^\n\nThe Psychlos refer to humans as  \" man animals  \" but yet dogs are still  \" dogs  \" .   ^\n\nWhy are n\'t   they  \" dog animals  \"  ?   ^\n\nThe Psychlos are after mining Earth \'s   precious resources  , but for 1,000 years are unaware of Fort Knox  ?   ^\n\nWhy do I even care at this point  ?   ^\n\nI \'m   a fan of Travolta \'s   and I \'m   glad to see he \'s   back on the A-List in Hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like Michael and Phenomenon  ) .   ^\n\nBut how did he possibly think this was a good movie  ?   ^\n\nAnd how did he think he was giving a good performance here  ?   ^\n\nHe \'s   more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see Broken Arrow and Face/Off  ) but whenever his character came on screen I could n\'t   hold back my laughter .   ^\n\nNow despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have  , Travolta just looks like Travolta .   ^\n\nAll of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face  , but Travolta just has a goatee .   ^\n\nAlso  , Travolta \'s   acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world .   ^\n\nOoooo  , scary villain .   ^\n\nAs a producer he should know better and as an actor he should DEFINITELY know better .   ^\n\nYou can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( I love Independence Day for example  )  , but there is absolutely NOTHING entertaining about Battlefield Earth .   ^\n\nI did everything I possibly could to stay awake during the screening   ...  ^\n\nI cleaned my glasses  , walked around the theater  , made a grocery list  , chose my lottery numbers for the week  , replayed Super Bowl XXV in my head ( with commercials  )  ... and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids .   ^\n\nBy the time we actually reach the year 3000  , people should still be avoiding this film .   ^\n\nFolks  , save your cash.. do n\'t   go see it  , do n\'t   rent it  , and do n\'t   buy it .   ^\n\nYou \'d   be more entertained by taking the money you \'d   use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind  , watching it sail away ( hell  , send it to us here at The Jacksonville Film Journal   ... we \'ll   entertain you plenty with that kind of money  ) .   ^\n\nUnless of course you \'re   just captivated by countless slow motion shots of Barry Pepper running  , which is just about all you \'ll   come away with from this movie .   ^\n\nThat  , and a headache .

cv756_23676.txt,'Jet Li busted onto the American action movie scene, when he stole the show    in 1998\'s LETHAL WEAPON 4, with his wicked looks, his nasty moves and his    undeniable charisma.^\n\nIt only took another two years for mega-producer Joel    Silver to set him up in an all-American movie , primed to take over some of    the empty action-hero seats left by alleged coke-head Van Damme and that    pudgy guy named Steven Seagal .^\n\nWould this film take Li past his rival Asian    action counterparts , namely Chow Yun-Fat and Jackie Chan ?^\n\nLet \'s  find out .    ^\n\nRival Chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of    favor from one another , when members of their respective families start    turning up dead .^\n\nThat \'s  when badass Jet Li blasts into the picture to find    out who the men were behind his brother \'s  death and to exact some of his own    style of revenge .    ^\n\nThree words : not enough action !^\n\nSimple enough ?^\n\nNot enough Hong    Kong  kickass  Jet  Li action to compensate for a horribly predictable    screenplay ,  bad  actors ,  crappy dialogue and oh-so many over-the-top    melodramatic moments .^\n\nAnd a romance angle ?^\n\nWhy , one must ask ... why ?^\n\nI love    fight scenes and I really dig Jet Li too , but this little ditty barely    contained three memorable action sequences , and Jet , well , the poor dude was    barely in the movie .^\n\nAnd I thought this was supposed to be his big break ?   ^\n\nHow  \'bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his    kung-fu fighting chops , slap him in a few more scenes , and give him more    chances to practice his acting/English abilities ?^\n\nWhat a letdown .^\n\nEven BLACK    MASK was more entertaining than this glossed up , empty shell of a film .^\n\nIn    fact ,  I am sure that more time was spent gathering the \" hits \" for the    soundtrack of this film , than were on the so-called \" screenplay \" .^\n\nI felt    like I was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time .    ^\n\nThe sad part about the bad script is that it would n\'t  matter so much if the    film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines .^\n\nBut no ,    save Lindo and Aaliyah , who were n\'t  too shabby , I thought the rest of the    cast  was  picked  primarily  from  their  inability  to deliver lines    convincingly .^\n\nAnd what was the deal with the whole NFL franchise deal run by    some 15-year old looking guy , acting like he \'s  the overlord of a drug ring ? !   ^\n\nWhat a mess .^\n\nThen again , I do n\'t  want it to seem like I \'m  complaining solely    about the story which was completely foreseeable , since we all go to see    these movies for the action anyway , not the story .^\n\nWell , I guess that \'s  what    disappointed me the most out of this film .^\n\nThere were a couple of cool fight    scenes with Li , but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving .^\n\nAlso ,    as much as I love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some    of their stunts , a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too    obvious a stunt .^\n\nIt should be seamless , fellas , not necessarily against the    laws of gravity !^\n\nThe one cool thing that was original in the movie was the    way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the    human  body  when penetrated by a blow , but that simple creative touch    could n\'t  save the rest of this film \'s  uninteresting plot movements .    ^\n\nI \'m   disappointed  for  Jet Li that this film did n\'t  give him the real    opportunity  to  star  in  a good story with many great action scenes .   ^\n\nHopefully , the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor .^\n\nFor    now , I just hope that for his sake , the film \'s  title is n\'t  a premonition of    the movie \'s  ultimate fate at the box-office .

cv758_9740.txt,'It was with a huge lack of something to do that I decided to watch this on good old UPN on sunday afternoon  , when the only good things on TV are the second-rate movies they show ( some are good  : they showed  \" Total Recall  \" before this one  ) .   ^\n\nIf you know me  , I think Seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live .   ^\n\nAnd this includes Keanu Reeves .  ^\n\nWhat do I hate about Seagal  ?   ^\n\nI hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non-threatening situation ( the squint  ) .   ^\n\nI hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around  , bullying people up  , saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than Burt Reynold \'s   hairpiece in  \" Boogie Nights .  \"   ^\n\nI despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights .   ^\n\nI hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain .   ^\n\nI hate his non-satirical messages ( in the beginning of this one  , he slaps on a quote from Arthur Miller  , which has nothing to do with the film  , except it \'s   about Brooklyn where this film takes place  ) .   ^\n\nAnd I hate how he \'s   so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing ( during the end credits  , he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him  ) .   ^\n\nSure  , the guy \'s   probably a nice guy in person ( I actually found him very non-threatening when he was on Letterman not too long ago  ) .   ^\n\nBut the guy makes worse films than Reagan did .  ^\n\nSo what \'s   the plot of this shit-terpiece  ?   ^\n\nWell  ... something about him trying to catch a stupid-ass crook ( William Forsythe  ) who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight .   ^\n\nI could n\'t   believe how bad this scene was - the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ( ahem  !  ) .   ^\n\nAnd Forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off .   ^\n\nI \'m   sorry  , did anyone ever hear of concealing one \'s   self  ?  ^\n\nSo in comes ex-Brooklynite Seagal  , who dedicates his life to catching this guy .   ^\n\nAnd I just wished he had caught him in the beginning  , then ended the film .   ^\n\nBut NOOOO  , this drags on  , as he bullies Forsythe \'s   family members ( including a stupid bar-owner  , and none other than Gina Gershon as his other bar-owner sister  ) .   ^\n\nAnd Forsythe more than once threatens his family .   ^\n\nAt one point  , he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a non-threatening Nicholson in  \" The Shining  \" ( complete with them all hiding in the bathroom  , but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away  ) .  ^\n\nSeagal paints himself as a lovable person  , with a son  , and a fiancee .   ^\n\nHe even shows him hanging with his son  , checking up on his homework  , and then about to take him out for a bit of  \" catch  ,  \" when he \'s   conveniently called away on assignment .   ^\n\nI dunno about you  , but playing  \" catch  \" with Seagal was one of my childhood nightmares .   ^\n\nHe also shows him as that bad-ass he wants to be  , with scenes of him bullying crooks around  , and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he \'s   unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue .   ^\n\nServes them right .  ^\n\nThis film  , as some of his do  , has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented  , but do n\'t   appear to be in this film .   ^\n\nI already mentioned Gina Gershon ( who \'s   pretty horrible in this one  )  , as well as William Forsythe  , who over-acts terribly .   ^\n\nI know this guy can act  : he was awesome in  \" Raising Arizona  \" as Goodman \'s   partner in crime .   ^\n\nBut he \'s   just awful here .   ^\n\nJerry Orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on Segal after things have gone down .   ^\n\nWhy is he the only one who gives a good performance  ?   ^\n\nWell  , because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility .   ^\n\nHe seems to be in here just to give it a cool  \" Law and Order  \" feeling ( even if it \'s   not a  \" cool  \" feeling  ) .   ^\n\nAnd in cameos are B-rated erotic-thriller-Cinemax-style stars  , Shannon Whirry ( as  \" Terry Malloy  ,  \" which is more of a bad joke than a clever one  ) and Athena Massey .   ^\n\nOh  !   ^\n\nAnd  \" ER\"\'s   Julliana Margiulles has two scenes .  ^\n\n\" Out for Justice  \" just proves once again that American action films just suck .   ^\n\nI know that there \'s   such a good thing as good action - he \'s   called John Woo .   ^\n\nBut if you \'re   in the mood for some good old no-brainer  , fun-yet-dumb action  , do n\'t   bother watching this .   ^\n\nIt \'s   so stupid that it \'s   boring .

cv759_15091.txt,'VAMPIRES starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti Western with an    attack on a small homestead in New Mexico.^\n\nThe house has a nest of vampires    and Jack Crow ( James Woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean    them out .^\n\nWhile the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way    to what is a fairly decent action sequence .^\n\nThat is enough action to last us    a while and we could , director John Carpenter would let us , get to a story    line .^\n\nBut it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big    action scene .^\n\nThen there is only a bit more of plot before the next action    scene after that .^\n\nThe plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in    the plot really get the short end .^\n\nAnd that is something of a pity because    the film , based on the book VAMPIRE$ by John Steakley , gives us a myth for    the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with    religious imagery .^\n\nThis could be an interesting departure from the standard    vampire film , but Carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show    it . ^\n\nWhat  Carpenter  saves  his serious screen time for a sequence of    spectacular fights between hunters and vampires .^\n\nThere is a lot of fighting    and lots of gore .^\n\nAnything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not    get in the way of pleasing the action film fans .^\n\nThis has not always been    Carpenter \'s   style . ^\n\nHis 1981 version of THE THING has action but also    challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film \'s  central    science fictional question .    ^\n\nJack Crow heads a vampire SWAT team , cleaning up nests of vampires with    high-tech spears and crossbows .^\n\nIn the early part of the film his team is    wiped out by a particularly mean vampire Valek ( Thomas Ian Griffith ) who has    been tipped off to who Crow is .^\n\nNow Crow team is gone and he is down to    himself and his sidekick Tony Montoya ( Daniel Baldwin ) .^\n\nTo make matters    worse , he does not know the people on his own side , Tony and his backers , he    can trust .^\n\nMeanwhile Jack is sure the vampires are looking for something    that must be hidden somewhere here in New Mexico .    ^\n\nIf this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few    obvious substitutions , that \'s  exactly what it is .^\n\nThe same story looks just    as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves    looking  for a packet of heroin .^\n\nBut Carpenter goes against a familiar    principle of film : show people , do n\'t  tell them .^\n\nJust about everything in    the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not    shown . ^\n\nFundamental questions in the plot like where does Crow get his    funding , why are the vampires in New Mexico -- what do they want and why do    they  want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the Catholic    Church , how did Crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to    it ?^\n\nThe answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but    instead are revealed through dialog .    ^\n\nNow  if  all this was not bad enough , Carpenter misuses the James Wood    persona . ^\n\nWoods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well .^\n\nBut    Carpenter leads off the film by having Woods do some Sergio-Leone- style    mythic posturing .^\n\nWhile his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring    fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target .^\n\nWoods does not    work as a larger than life mythic hero .^\n\nThat is not his style and it just    does not work very well .^\n\nThere are some simple things that Carpenter should    be looking for as director that he misses .^\n\nIn one scene we are looking at a    motel room with dead people on the floor .^\n\nOne female corpse is on the floor    in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her    and the chair .^\n\nAs the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes    it obvious her arm is moving up and down .^\n\nOne also wonders how the existence    of vampires is kept secret .^\n\nThese vampires do not maintain a low profile .    ^\n\nThere are arguably logical flaws in the film .^\n\nThere is some question in my    mind whether Carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have    on vampires .^\n\nIt would take some rationalization to explain why in some    scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the    end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams    of sunlight .    ^\n\nI suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out .   ^\n\nWhile I might recommend this film to an action audience I would say that    what I look for in a vampire film VAMPIRES rates aon thetoscale and aon the    -4 to +4 scale .^\n\nPerhaps I will read the book .

cv760_8977.txt,'When considering David Fincher\'s latest film, \"The Game\", four words come to    mind.^\n\n\" Do n\'t  believe the hype . \"^\n\nThis Michael Douglas vehicle , from the    director of \" Seven \" , is n\'t  nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as    it would have us believe .    ^\n\nThe film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the    riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( Douglas ) is presented with the    opportunity  to enter into a living fantasy .^\n\nThis is n\'t  simply virtual    reality .^\n\nThis is real life with a deadly twist .    ^\n\nOn his 48th birthday , Nicholas Van Orton ( Douglas ) is invited to dinner by    his underachieving younger brother , Conrad ( Sean Penn ) .^\n\nConrad has a special    birthday present for his brother .^\n\nHe hands Nicholas a gift certificate and    tells him to contact a company called Consumer Recreation Services .^\n\n\" They    make your life fun , \" Conrad tells him .^\n\nNicholas humors his brother , telling    him he \'ll  call , but it \'s  clear he has no time for any foolish , \" fantasy    role-playing , \" as he calls it .    ^\n\nThen , for reasons that are never really made clear , Nicholas decides to go    to CRS and see what they \'re  all about .^\n\nHe ends up spending a whole day going    through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the    tight  schedule he keeps claiming to have .^\n\nNevertheless , when it seems    Nicholas  has  been  rejected  as a CRS client , the weird things start    happening .^\n\nOf course , when we \'ve  only covered aboutminutes of screen time ,    what else should we expect .    ^\n\nDouglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and    unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands .^\n\nOne of those films , \" Basic    Instinct \" ,  came  from the creative minds of writer , Joe Eszterhas and    director , Paul Verhoeven .    ^\n\nThe premise of \" The Game , \" is not unlike the concept of another Verhoeven    film , \" Total Recall . \"^\n\nIn that case , the premise was implanting someone    else \'s  memories as a way to enhance one \'s  own life through a dream vacation .   ^\n\nYet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the    audience .^\n\nWe live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each    twist and turn .^\n\nIn theory , the key to the suspense is not being to tell what    is real and what is n\'t  .^\n\nAll we can do is hang on until the end of the ride ,    when the truth is finally revealed .    ^\n\nNow , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again .^\n\n\" Do n\'t  believe the    hype . \" ^\n\n\" The  Game \"  is  not  a  thrilling  roller  coaster ride .^\n\nAs a    suspense-thriller , it does n\'t  do much but spin in circles .^\n\nBy the third    reel , I was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as I endured the    predictable plot .^\n\nIs it any wonder Douglas wo n\'t  be able to resist the    charms of a mysterious , potentially life-threatening blonde ( ever heard of    Glenn Close ?^\n\nNo ?^\n\nWell , how about Sharon Stone ?^\n\nThought so ) .    ^\n\nIf anything in this film surprises you at all , I would guess you have n\'t     seen that many films .^\n\nThere is no suspense here .^\n\nTrust me , I looked hard to    find  some . ^\n\nI  had  to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously    implausible situations .^\n\nFincher aim \'s  for Hitchcock but lands somewhere just    north of Joe Eszterhas .    ^\n\nThere are those that might say \" The Game \" is not intended to be viewed    literally .^\n\nI would submit that is exactly the way I tried to view the film .   ^\n\nThe film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological    issues .    ^\n\nThere is a moment early in the film where Van Orton , realizing his game has    begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who \'s  in    on the whole thing .^\n\nHe is charged by his paranoia .^\n\nHe is looking at the    world through new eyes .^\n\nIt is the last thought-provoking moment in the film .   ^\n\nFrom there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us .^\n\nAny    significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply    turned into a plot device .^\n\nAt the outset , we \'re  told each \" game \" is tailored    to  the individual .^\n\nUltimately , this \" game \" is supposed to work like a    crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and

cv761_13769.txt,'Weighed down by tired plot lines and Spielberg \'s  reliance on formulas ,    _Saving Private Ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of    realism before descending into an abyss of cliches .    ^\n\nThere ought to be a law against Steven Spielberg making movies about truly    serious topics .^\n\nSpielberg \'s  greatest strength as a director is the polished ,    formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place    to make a perfect story .^\n\nBut for a topic of such weight as combat in the    second world war ( or the Holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates    coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size ,    complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken .^\n\nIn this way    Spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films.     _Saving Private Ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on    a \" PR mission \" to pull a young man , Ryan ( whose three other brothers were    just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the Normandy front just    after D-Day .^\n\nRyan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night    before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers .^\n\nThe    search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of World    War II combat in France .    ^\n\nThere \'s  no denying Spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great    war  movie .^\n\nThe equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done .^\n\nThe    opening sequence , in which Captain Miller ( Tom Hanks ) leads his men onto    Omaha Beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually    capturing  the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat .   ^\n\nAnother pleasing aspect of the film is Spielberg \'s  brave depiction of scenes    largely unknown to American audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by    Allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in    the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops .^\n\nThe technical side    of the film is peerless , as always .^\n\nThe camera work is magnificent , the    pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw .^\n\nHanks will    no doubt be nominated for an Oscar for his performance , which was utterly    convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though Ted Danson seems a    mite out of place as a paratroop colonel .    ^\n\nYet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face    because  realism  is  not something which can be represented by single    instances or events .^\n\nIt has to thoroughly permeate the context at every    level of the film , or the story fails to convince .^\n\nThroughout the movie    Spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds    produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to    death with relative frequency ) .^\n\nFor example , we see only one man with guts    spilled out on the ground .^\n\nHere and there men lose limbs ; in one scene    Miller is pulling a man to safety , there \'s  an explosion , and Miller looks    back to see he is only pulling half a man .^\n\nBut the rest of the corpses are    remarkably intact .^\n\nThere are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs    scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most    importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of    wicked head wounds ) .^\n\nThe relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even    corpses  failed  to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film .   ^\n\nUltimately , _Saving Private Ryan_ bows to both Hollywood convention and the    unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death    in war .^\n\nRather than saying _Saving Private Ryan_ is \" realistic , \" it would be    better to describe it as \" having realistic moments . \"    ^\n\nAnother aspect of the \" Hollywoodization \" of the war is the lack of realistic    dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing .^\n\nAnyone familiar with the    literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as Fussell \'s     superb _Wartime : Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War_ ( which    has  an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore    fluently and without letup .^\n\n\" Who is this Private Ryan that we have to die    for him ? \" asks one infantrymen in the group of eight .^\n\nRendered in wartime    demotic , that should have been expressed as \" Who is this little pecker that    we  have  to get our dicks shot off for him ? \" or some variant thereof .   ^\n\nConversations should have been literally sprinkled with the \" F \" word , and    largely  about  ( the  search  for )  food and sex .^\n\nThis is all the more    inexplicable because the movie already had an \" R \" rating due to violence , so    swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film .    ^\n\nHowever , the most troubling aspect of the film is the Spielbergization of    the topic .^\n\nThe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is    not emotionally wrenching enough for Steven Spielberg .^\n\nHe cannot just cede    control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it .^\n\nAs if afraid to let    the  viewer  find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear )    emotional foothold in the material , Spielberg has to package it in Hallmark    moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening    and closing scenes of Ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of    the closing scene from _Schindler \'s  List ) , the saccharine exchange between    Ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as Schindler \'s  monologue    about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another Jew ) , quotes from    Abraham Lincoln and Emerson , Captain Miller \'s  last words to Private Ryan ,    and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in    the movie comes back to kill the Captain .^\n\nThat particular subplot is so    hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film .    ^\n\nNowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness ,    stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who    actually fought in combat ( imagine if Miller had been killed by friendly    fire or collateral damage ) .^\n\nBecause of its failure to mine deeply into the    terrible realities of World War II , _Saving Private Ryan_ can only pan for    small truths in the shallows.'
cv762_15604.txt,'If you \'re   going to make a two-hour Hollywood in-joke  , why bother releasing it to the general public  ?   ^\n\nIf you \'re   going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and People Who Know Woody Allen  , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters  ?   ^\n\nWhile watching Celebrity  , I realized that Allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people .   ^\n\nWhat he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation .   ^\n\nCelebrity is yet another film in which Allen tells a story about himself  , living in a world that he \'s   familiar with  , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows .  ^\n\nAllen recruited poor Kenneth Branagh to bumble through this picture  , in an imitation of Allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more .   ^\n\nBranagh plays Lee Simon  , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife  , Robin ( Judy Davis  )  , shacks up with some hot women ( Famke Janssen  , Charlize Theron  , Winona Ryder  )  , and goes about trying to get big stars ( Melanie Griffith  , Leonardo DiCaprio  ) to read his script about an armored car robbery .   ^\n\nThe usual elements of recent Allen films are all here  , including the sexual insecurity of the main character  , lots of self-loathing women  , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another .    ^\n\nUnless you work in the film industry or know Woody Allen personally  , it \'s   not likely that you \'ll   find a whole lot of interest in Celebrity .   ^\n\nAside from all the in-jokes  , the story falls far short of compelling  , and the characters are all empty and lifeless .   ^\n\nBranagh proves once again that he \'s   a superb performer  , nailing his imitation of Allen flawlessly .   ^\n\nThe problem is that he \'s   the same character Allen always plays  , a character who \'s   getting more than a little dull to watch .   ^\n\nI mean  , come on  , how many times have you seen this guy  ? --   he hates his work  , and he ca n\'t   be satisfied by any one woman  , and  , at the end of the movie  , nothing has been solved .   ^\n\nHe brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he \'s   receiving fellatio  , and other such stunts  )  , so it \'s   pretty hard to care about him .   ^\n\nIn addition  , is n\'t   Allen capable of creating characters who are n\'t   just like him  ?   ^\n\nI know he is  , but he did n\'t   do it in Celebrity .  ^\n\nThe vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances .   ^\n\nDavis  , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in Deconstructing Harry  , has a few touching moments  , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie .   ^\n\nSome of the actresses are saved because of their beauty --   Theron and Ryder  , especially --   but they \'re   not likable people .   ^\n\nOnly Famke Janssen  , as a book editor interested in Simon \'s   new novel  , has any life .   ^\n\nThe men in the picture do n\'t   do much better --   Joe Mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries Robin  , while DiCaprio  , as a Christian Slater/Johnny Depp-type spoiled young actor  , is funny but disengaging .  ^\n\nWhat \'s   really insulting about Celebrity is how dull and standard its  \" themes  \" are .   ^\n\nAllen seems to think that he \'s   making an insightful movie about the way  \" normal  \" people look at celebrities .   ^\n\nThe main problem with this is that the character with whom we \'re   supposed to identify  , Simon  , is not a  \" normal  \" guy --   he \'s   just as entrenched in the Hollywood image as the rest of the characters .   ^\n\nThe other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us --   none of them register as realistic  , interesting characters  ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue .   ^\n\nIn addition  , Allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( Robin  , in this scene  , says something like  ,  \" It \'s   interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate  !  \"  ) .    ^\n\nCelebrity is arguably Allen \'s   biggest misfire to date .   ^\n\nIt does have a few good scenes --   Theron \'s   super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny  , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two .   ^\n\nBut Celebrity is a failure at the core  , unless Allen \'s   point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends .   ^\n\nIf he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke  , then he succeeded in that .   ^\n\nI  , for one  , do n\'t   enjoy feeling like an outsider .

 ^\n\nI think it is - it \'s   hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously .   ^\n\n( One of my favourites was when Bane helpfully grunted  \" Bomb  !  \" each time he laid down an explosive device in the Gotham Observatory .  )   ^\n\nIs it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be  ?  ^\n\nI somehow doubt it - the subplot involving Afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film is n\'t   attempting to be the utter farce which it is .   ^\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous Mr. Freeze  , and is bland and uninteresting  , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be .   ^\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger \'s   attempts to be menacing are laughable  , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable  ; frankly  , everything he does onscreen is laughable .   ^\n\nBy the end of the film  , I was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen .   ^\n\nThe bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of  \" Cool  !  \" in the least inventive way .   ^\n\nGeorge Clooney has been given very little to do in BATMAN AND ROBIN  , being overshadowed by the villains  , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film .   ^\n\nHis Batman is hardly an imposing figure .   ^\n\nChris O\'Donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance  , while Alicia Silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all .   ^\n\nThe film \'s   one saving grace  ?

 ^\n\nPoor Patillo has been trying to get ahead  in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless  anchorman Harry Shearer .  ^\n\nItalian cameraman Hank Azaria tells her  she \'s   not ruthless enough  :  \" Nice does n\'t   get you anywhere in this town .   ^\n\nIt \'s   dog eat dog .  \"          ^\n\nActually  , it \'s   lizard eat city  , as Godzilla emerges from the  Atlantic to begin a rampage on the Big Apple \'s   core .  ^\n\nThe filmmakers  provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks Godzilla .  ^\n\n\" I  think I \'ve   got a bite  ,  \" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins  rushing toward him .  ^\n\nYou can guess what happens next .  ^\n\nSimilar  reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city .  ^\n\nHearing the  rumble of approaching footsteps  , one New Yorker remarks  ,  \" Please  do n\'t   tell me that \'s   another parade .  \"  ^\n\nPlease do n\'t   tell me that \'s   the best  line you could come up with .          ^\n\nMayor Ebert is not pleased .  ^\n\nPlayed by the principal from   \" Head of the Class  ,  \" he continually makes the wrong decision when  given an option  , and bickers with his assistant Gene .  ^\n\nI guess the  filmmakers knew they \'d   be getting two thumbs down from the critics  and did n\'t   even bother to kiss ass .  ^\n\nThe problem is  , if you \'re   going to  attack Siskel and Ebert  , you should at least make it funny .  ^\n\nDialogue  like  ,  \" Did n\'t   we agree that we were n\'t   going to have any sweets until  after the election  ?  \" followed by  ,  \" Back off  , Gene  ,  \" just does n\'t   work for  me .  ^\n\nOther lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the  Broderick character \'s   last name and Frenchman Jean Reno \'s   inability  to find a good cup of coffee in New York .          ^\n\nThere \'s   even more fun to be had as GODZILLA progresses .  ^\n\nAs  the beast heads back into hiding  , Broderick suggests the military lure  it out with food .  ^\n\nCue twelve dump trucks  , all dropping fish into a New  York intersection .  ^\n\n( BRODERICK  : That \'s   a lot of fish .  )  ^\n\nThat ambush fails  ,  but Broderick soon figures out why Godzilla came to New York by  buying $ 50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood  through them .  ^\n\nYep  , Godzilla \'s   with children  , which makes you wonder  just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with  Godzilla .  ^\n\nThat \'s   until Broderick explains that Godzilla reproduces  asexually  , like Linda Tripp .          ^\n\nGODZILLA comes to us from the makers of INDEPENDENCE DAY  ,  so it has a lot of dumb action scenes  , destructive special effects and  shallow subplots .  ^\n\nLook no further than Patillo \'s   betrayal of Broderick  ( PATILLO  : What have I done  , Animal  ?

cv778_18629.txt,'David Spade has a snide, sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on    the TV sitcom Just Shoot Me.^\n\nIt also served as a good showcase for him when    he co-starred , opposite the late Chris Farley , in Tommy Boy and Black Sheep .   ^\n\nLost and Found marks the comedian \'s  first attempt at going solo in a movie ,    and it also reveals that when Spade does n\'t  have a reliable back-up system ,    his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect .    ^\n\nDavid Spade is not the problem with Lost and Found .^\n\nHe plays Dylan Ramsey ,    the sweet main character , to the best of his abilities .^\n\nThe story revolves    around Dylan \'s  obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour , Lila Dubois    ( Sophie  Marceau ,  from Braveheart ) , and her terrier named Jack .^\n\nDylan    believes that the best way to a woman \'s  heart is through her dog .^\n\nAnd so he    kidnaps Jack , planning to stage a fake rescue , in hope to win Lila over .    ^\n\nThere are three good things about Lost and Found .^\n\nThe first is Spade .^\n\nThe    second is Sophie Marceau , a lovely actress who \'s  been planted into the wrong    movie .^\n\nLastly , there \'s  the dog , who is used here in a similar context to    Puffy  from There \'s  Something About Mary .^\n\nUnfortunately , director Jeff    Pollack finds more humor in putting Jack through a cycle in the drier than    he does with simply making him look cute .^\n\nThis kind of physical humor is    dead .^\n\nPollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to    get laughs , and this procedure is cheap , unfunny and resoundingly cruel .    ^\n\nThis  is  where  I  start  to get fuzzy .^\n\nAlso in this unusual blend is    ( apparently ) a sweet-natured love story between Dylan and Lila .^\n\nGiven the    mean-spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for , I found this    hard to swallow .^\n\nAnd , why does Dylan even deserve someone like Lila , after    kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain ?^\n\nPredictably ,    Lost and Found opts for a happy ending , one that feels so sentimental ,    gooey , and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes    you feel a bit cheated .    ^\n\nDavid Spade ( who also co-wrote the movie ) tries hard , so very hard , to make    this project amusing .^\n\nThere are some choice scenes that are quite funny , but    the  movie  is  only sporadically funny .^\n\nPatrick Bruel plays the stock    character of Rene , the pompous jerk who also wants to win Lila over , with    his good looks and money .^\n\nJon Lovitz and Martin Sheen are welcome additions    in two tiny supporting roles .    ^\n\nDespite a few positive attributes , Lost and Found just does n\'t  work .^\n\nIf    you \'re  searching for an enjoyable romantic-comedy , you could do far better    than this obvious , misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what    it \'s  trying to present .    ^\n\nJamey Hughton was a 1999 Writing Finalist in the YTV Achievement Awards and    writes a Published Column in The StarPhoenix ( Saskatoon Sk .^\n\nCanada ) .

Russell plays Cash  , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts .   ^\n\nStallone plays Tango  , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it  ; he does n\'t   need the money .   ^\n\nIn an effort to change his image  , Stallone goes for a yuppie  , GQ look in the film  , wearing spectacles and three piece suits .   ^\n\nThe two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names .          ^\n\nTANGO & CASH is unbearably noisy .   ^\n\nFor starters  , there \'s   Harold Faltermeyer \'s   annoying synthesized score  , which gets old after four notes .  ^\n\nTo make matters worse  , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars  , the more the merrier .   ^\n\nIn fact  , the movie begins with not one but two car chases .   ^\n\nThere \'s   nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie .          ^\n\nScreenwriter Randy Feldman \'s   brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on TV .   ^\n\nHis shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it  , such as Stallone \'s   efforts to convince you that Tango is an intellectual .   ^\n\nIn a movie with the IQ level of an amoeba  , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent --  and Stallone is no Lawrence Olivier .   ^\n\nIt \'s   hard to imagine anyone reading Feldman \'s   script and thinking  ,  \" I want to be in this movie .  \"          ^\n\nThe film \'s   plot does n\'t   have one original bone in its body  , and --  again --  you have to point your finger at the screenwriting .   ^\n\nFeldman \'s   story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book  , making TANGO & CASH altogether generic and predictable .   ^\n\nThey simply could have called it  \" Action Movie .  \"   ^\n\nEvery character  , every twist and turn  , is stolen from television or from other movies .   ^\n\nAdding insult to injury  , TANGO & CASH is about as believable as a  \" Road Runner  \" cartoon .   ^\n\nAction movies do n\'t   have to be realistic  , but they should absorb you enough so that you \'re   not thinking about the lack of realism .          ^\n\nThe only artistic aspect of TANGO & CASH is the cinematography .  ^\n\nThere are some spectacular shots  , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which Tango and Cash slide to safety on electrical wires .          ^\n\nThe film \'s   main draw is the chemistry between Stallone and Russell .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants .   ^\n\nThe dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners  , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing .   ^\n\nIt \'s   a shame because with a workable screenplay  , Russell and Stallone could have turned TANGO & CASH into a charming  \" Lethal Weaponesque  \" adventure .          ^\n\nTANGO & CASH tries to maintain a light tone  , and you do laugh about once every five minutes .   ^\n\nSeeing Russell in drag is the movie \'s   funniest moment  , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials .  ^\n\nFurthermore  , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence .   ^\n\nMachine guns and torture generally do n\'t   mix well with comedy .          ^\n\nJack Palance appears in TANGO & CASH doing what he does best  : playing a sleazy  , conniving villain .   ^\n\nHis character  , however  , is run-of-the-mill  , except for his strange obsession with mice .   ^\n\nLike many movie villains  , Palance likes to play games .   ^\n\nIn fact  , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for Tango and Cash  , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room .   ^\n\nYou have to wonder why Palance does n\'t   just shoot the detectives in the head  !   ^\n\nThe story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent .          ^\n\nTeri Hatcher plays Stallone \'s   sister and Russell \'s   love-interest  , and she is just as pretty as can be .   ^\n\nBut regrettably  , Hatcher \'s   acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty .   ^\n\nEvery time she opens her mouth  , you cringe  ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination .          ^\n\nThere \'s   really very little  , if anything  , to recommend in the film .  ^\n\nAnd  , more to the point  , TANGO definitely is n\'t   worth a penny of your cash --  so do n\'t   bother  .'

Peter Iliff is n\'t   of any help  , he is still certainly  not in the league of Tom Cruise in  \" All the Right Moves .  \"  ^\n\nThe story  revolving around John  , meanwhile  , is extemely thin throughout  ,  particularly for its 104-minute running time  , and it alternates between  uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education  teacher working as a stripper at the club  ) and heavy-handed melodrama .   ^\n\nThe romance between John and his girlfriend had the potential to be an  adequate subplot  , but we also learned very little about her  , which is  unfortunate since Amy Smart  , whom I do n\'t   think I \'ve   seen before in past  films  , is probably the only character written with any sort of  intelligence .  ^\n\nSmart does not allow her character to become the  \" passive  girlfriend  ,  \" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and  opinions .  ^\n\nIt \'s   too bad the camera did n\'t   linger on her long enough so we  could hear some of those thoughts .  ^\n\nThe adult characters probably fare the worse of any  , since they all must  play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but  football .  ^\n\nJohn \'s   relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed  far in advance .  ^\n\nHis father is set on him becoming a football player at a  university  , but John does n\'t   want any part of that .  ^\n\nHis mother stands  beside her  \" big  , strong husband  \" and is a passive female .  ^\n\nFinally  , Jon  Voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make  the thankless role any more than one-dimensional .  ^\n\nSaving  \" Varsity Blues  \" from being a total washout are a few amusing  sequences  , including one set in the sex education class  , which did get a  laugh out of me .  ^\n\nThe scenes of playing football were well-shot and  thankfully did n\'t   overstay their welcome  , as many sports films fall  victim to .  ^\n\nBut leaving the theater  , the question I had in my mind was  why did this film need to be made  ?  ^\n\nI seem to be asking this question  quite a lot lately  , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out  of Hollywood .  ^\n\nDo we really need another high-school sports film  ?  ^\n\nNo  , we  do n\'t    , and certainly not one of this low-caliber  , which felt like a  cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better  , but similar  , films .   ^\n\n\" Varsity Blues  ,  \" no doubt is the first one  , however  , to include an  earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped  cream on their private parts  .'
cv785_23748.txt,'For a film touted as exploring relationships and Black sexuality  , Trois is surprisingly tame .  ^\n\nDespite it \'s   lurid subject matter and it \'s   passing nod to Fatal Attraction  , it moves along with flat  , uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film .  ^\n\nFreshly moved to Atlanta  , Jermaine ( Dourdan  ) and his wife  , Jasmine ( Moore  )  , have the trappings of a perfect life .  ^\n\nThey have a beautiful house in suburbia .  ^\n\nJermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm .  ^\n\nJasmine is his supportive wife  , who is finishing up her college degree .   ^\n\nIn an opening montage via a home video of the pair  , we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs .  ^\n\nThis is a couple that has it all .  ^\n\nInto this Eden slithers the lure of lust .  ^\n\nDespite his outward appearance  , Jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person .  ^\n\nA glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business  , oblivious to Jasmine \'s   concerns .  ^\n\nWe also find that he has been relentlessly asking Jasmine to participate in a menage- a-trois  , much to Jasmine \'s   dismay .  ^\n\nAs Jermaine puts it  ,  \" Do n\'t   you want to be sexually free  ?  \"  ^\n\nJermaine shares his desire with  co-worker Terrence ( Smith  )  , who obligingly sets Jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter .  ^\n\nThe woman  , Jade ( Palmer  ) is a direct counterpoint to Jasmine .  ^\n\nJade  , at one point was a college student  , too .  ^\n\nUnlike Jasmine  , she found herself pregnant  , dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet .  ^\n\nTo further reinforce their differences  , it \'s   revealed that Jade is involved in a custody battle over her son .  ^\n\nInevitably  , through liquor and a touch of duplicity on Jermaine \'s   part  , the forbidden act is consummated .  ^\n\nThe aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into Fatal Attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon Jermaine \'s   property with the hint that the violence may escalate .  ^\n\nBy this point  , Trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama  : a Fatal Attraction without the social significance .  ^\n\nThe exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical .  ^\n\nJermaine comes off as insincere  , sexually driven and selfish .  ^\n\nJasmine is bland and subservient .  ^\n\nJade comes off a bit sympathetically  , but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy .  ^\n\nYet another tale of a sexually aggressive  \" dog  \" of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating  , innocent mate .  ^\n\nThe last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve  , but by this point  , will you even care  ?  ^\n\nIf the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending  , perhaps there could have been some freshness to it .  ^\n\nAs it stands  , Trois is pretty standard fare .

cv786_23608.txt,'\"Mission to Mars\" is one of those annoying movies where, in the middle of    the movie, you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks    so good is because they showcased ALL the best parts of the movie: all five    minutes of it.^\n\n\" Mission \" does give you payoff ; but when it does come , it \'s     too little , too late .    ^\n\n\" Mission \" has some good ideas , but they get lost in the unbearably boring    delivery ,  dime-a-dozen  dialogue ,  and spate of good actors wasted in    cardboard-cutout roles .^\n\nI \'m  sure the director and writers were very proud of    each Hallmark moment they came up with , so they stretch each dramatic moment    out like silly putty until it loses all its charm .^\n\nGlances do n\'t  communicate    any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end .   ^\n\nThe film spends an hour on this kind of stuff , building to its climax .^\n\nA lot    of  it  is  a cliched glorification of family relationships , marriage ,    friendship , unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap .^\n\nThere are some    spectacular special effects sequences in this film , and I give it points for    trying to stay true to the science I know ( trying is the key word here ) .^\n\nThe    sequence with the Martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and    touching , but as mentioned by then we \'re  so sick of the goddamn thing we    want the movie to be over .^\n\nGreat design , good intentions , but no cigar .^\n\nIf    you \'re  not a die hard sci-fi , FX or Jerry O\'Connell fan ( his character is    the only one who has some semblance of character ) , do n\'t  waste your eight    bucks on this .    ^\n\nAnd what the hell , Tim Robbins died halfway through the movie , in a STUPID    way too .^\n\nThat \'s  just unforgiveable .

cv787_15277.txt,'My friend here in film school just made a two minute-long film for one of    his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene, done by two guys and    shot  on  the  shadow of the incident, with a banana being used as the    instrument of penetration.^\n\nAs sick as this all is , watching it is one of the    most admittingly hysterical moments I \'ve  ever witnessed .^\n\nSure , it may be in    bad taste , but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be    offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest ?    ^\n\nThen  there \'s   \" Caligula . \" ^\n\nThis  film  features  incest , necrophilia ,    beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and    lengthy orgies , a greased-up fist forced up a man \'s  rear , wine poured down a    man who \'s  had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to    hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc. This could very well be a respectable film , and    if  could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were    graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock    comically but to , well , show \" historical accuracy ; \" c ) the film was amillion    dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping    hour running time .    ^\n\nProduced and funded by none other than Bob Guccione , owner of Penthouse    Magazine , \" Caligula \" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture    since  \" PlanFrom  Outer Space \" because underneath there \'s  a sense that    everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also    brilliantly entertaining .^\n\nAfter all , it \'s  not really the fact that this film    features  the  aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually    believes in them as dramatic weaponry .^\n\nNo film should be discarded because    its content , because film is never about what it \'s  about , it \'s  about how    it \'s  about ( as the old cliche goes ) .^\n\nThose who bash this film for content    are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with \" Caligula , \" and    that \'s  that it \'s  nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish ,    without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time .    ^\n\n\" Caligula \" allegedly tells the true story of the evil Roman Emporer of the    same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as    a blessing ... or so I guess , even though almost every single Roman Emporer    was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons .^\n\nThe film opens on the    wrong note , of course , with a quote from Mark appearing before any image    graces the screen , using the over-used passage \" What shall it profit a man    if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , \" depite the fact    that  the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an    emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( I suppose if one has    to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place ) .    ^\n\nThe plot is so incomprehensibly done that all I or anyone else can make out    of it is that Caligula ( disastrously played by the great Malcom McDowell , a    performance that does the opposite that his performance in \" A Clockwork    Orange \" did ) is next in line for the throne but ca n\'t  wait for the current    Emporer , Tiberius ( Peter O\' Toole -

it \'s  that in a film where the entire    feel it \'s  going for is n\'t  felt , it \'s  also the sloppiest expensive movie of    all time .^\n\nThe sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that I wonder if    no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this .^\n\nBut that    does n\'t  matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a    light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just    plain dark .^\n\nThe camera operation is also the worst I \'ve  ever seen in my    entire  life . ^\n\nNot  only  does  this film hold the record for the most    unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose    its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of    focus .^\n\nThe editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible    to follow .^\n\nThere is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that    it \'s   \" adapted  from  an  original  screenplay  by  Gore Vidal ? \" ) , but    nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that I ca n\'t  in good    faith believe that anyone with an IQ overcould say them with a straight face    ( my favorite being the line when Caligula inquires the doctor about the    health of the dying Tiberius : \" He could go at any moment , but with care , he    could last a year or so . \" )^\n\nThe music in this film is mostly Prokofiev and    Khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous \" Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia , \" ad    nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead    feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere .^\n\nThe orgy scenes ( and one    infamous  lesbo  scene  between  Penthouse Pets Lori Wagner and Aneeka    DiLorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by Guccione himself , which are so    obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the    embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if    it  was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated \" X \" ) .^\n\nJohn    Gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief    role as if he was constantly the mantra , \" I \'m  going to kill my agent , I \'m     going to kill my agent  ... \"    ^\n\nAnd so on and so on , for over hours , making \" Caligula \" about as exciting and    enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously    annoying .^\n\nGuccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a    film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that    I  doubt  anyone  can  sit  through an hour of it without irreversible    psychological damage .^\n\nThroughout the entire film , the presence of Guccione    is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen ,    pretentiously looking down upon us saying \" Look what I can get away with !   ^\n\nAnd if you do n\'t  like this , then you \'re  a prig , and worse than that , you    know nothing about history ! \"^\n\nUh huh .    ^\n\nThere \'s  a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something    that \'s  artistically good .^\n\nA film which showed Roman decadence as something    that  was  perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would    probably make for a good film .^\n\nBut using historical accuracy as a licence to    get away with any kind of disgusting-for-disgustingness\'-sake acts is total ,    total bullshit , and all I can say is that Guccione and the makers of this    film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and    have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this    film .    ^\n\nThere \'s  a film that came out in 1989 called \" The Cook , the Thief , His Wife ,    and Her Lover , \" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director Peter Greenaway    ( also starring Helen Mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping    violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure .^\n\nThat film    not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that    was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally    involving .^\n\nThere were real characters there in a real situation , and best of    all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the    fact that it \'s  going to be offensive to many .^\n\nThat film achieved everything    it wanted to do , and has since retained a status as one of those cult films    that is not only popular but actualy good .^\n\nAnd it \'s  everything \" Caligula \"    might have been but , alas , was n\'t  .    ^\n\n'

It \'s   not that Macdonald is n\'t   a funny guy .   ^\n\nHe was one of the more consistently funny performers on _Saturday_Night_Live_ before his much-talked-about firing  , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen  ; it also does n\'t   hurt that he \'s   a natural  , likable screen presence .   ^\n\nHe is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch  , but  , for the most part  , the oneliners  , as written  , are flat  , and the broad slapstick gags just do n\'t   work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings --  a real riot  ) .  ^\n\nStill  , Macdonald \'s   few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has .  ^\n\nThe late Chris Farley  , as hysterical as he ever was  , is amusing in a cameo role  , but  , as a whole  , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance .  ^\n\nSaget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by Gary Coleman  , Adam Sandler  , and John Goodman  , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _Dirty_Work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time .   ^\n\nThe film closes on a sad note of desperation  , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement .   ^\n\nCome to think of it  , I cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _Dirty_Work_ .

Salmones; editor: Luis Manuel del Valle; cast:    Jeff Goldblum (Howard Pigeon), Mimi Rogers (Elizabeth Pigeon), Burt Kwouk    (Priest), Juan Echanove (Detective), Santiago Alvarez (Best Friend), Ricard    Borras (Father), 1992)     A silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight    comedy, with its main asset being a beautiful film location along Spain\'s    mountainous  coastline.^\n\nHoward Pigeon ( Jeff Goldblum ) is a 40-year-old    mineral water salesman who is married foryears to a wife constantly nagging    him , Elizabeth ( Mimi Rogers ) .^\n\nAfter a surprise birthday party for him , where    his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party , he confides to    his best friend that he ca n\'t  stand it anymore , and then tells him his plan    to kill her while vacationing in the same Barcelona hotel where they spent    their honeymoon .    ^\n\nJeff is going through a severe mid-life crises , worried that he looks older    than his age .^\n\nHe incessantly talks to himself , mostly agonizing over his    bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with Elizabeth for a    second time , and then why he married her just because she laughed at his    jokes and was attractive .^\n\nHe stutters and acts like a man who has lost his    confidence .    ^\n\nThings change on their vacation , as Elizabeth makes an effort to be nice    while Jeff now becomes the grouch .^\n\nHe nervously rehearses his murder plan in    the hotel room .^\n\nBy accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he    imagined Elizabeth would be sitting .^\n\nWhen other hotel guests and staff come    to  check about the gunshot , he nervously explains that it was the TV .   ^\n\nRealizing how unworkable his plan is , he places the gun in the shattered    pillow  and throws it into the ocean while he waits for Elizabeth .^\n\nBut    Elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip , and when after a    great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel\'sstar restaurant he    insists on eating in the room , she decides she had enough of him and checks    out without telling him .^\n\nAs a result , he goes to the police to report her    missing .    ^\n\nWhile with the police , a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him    and is going away because she wants to be alone .^\n\nHis boss and all those he    works with are sympathetic to him , and he gets a job promotion .^\n\nBut soon the    pillow with the gun is fished out of the water , giving the police cause to    arrest him and search his home .^\n\nThere they find letters he has written    incriminating him to the murder .^\n\nThe police also find out from the hotel    staff about the gunshot heard in his room .    ^\n\nIn jail , things look bad for him .^\n\nNo one believes him , including his friends    and lawyer .^\n\nHis boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the    headline story : Pigeon : A Jailbird .^\n\nOut on bail , he realizes that his only    hope is to track down his wife .    ^\n\nThrough a call placed on his credit card , he tracks her down to a mountain    resort .^\n\nOnce there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and    he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story .    ^\n\nThe  film  is watchable just for the antics of the Jeff Goldblum comic    performance .^\n\nHe is someone coming apart by the seams , while Mimi Rogers is    his perfect foil .^\n\nIt was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy charged in    the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the    situation .^\n\nA very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd .^\n\nThe    film just did n\'t  take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in    it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop .^\n\nIt instead played its    set-up  of  the  henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for    entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw .    ^\n\nDennis Schwartz : \" Ozus \' World Movie Reviews \"     ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DENNIS SCHWARTZ '

  ^\n\nSome rednecks fucking with these kids ?^\n\nAre either of these things really    scary when you think about it ? ? ?    ^\n\nI \'ve  heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it    can be to be out in the woods and hear something .^\n\nWell sure thats scary in    real life , but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that    are not scary in a movie nor even interesting .^\n\nYou could sit in your house    and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary , but in a film it would n\'t     be .    ^\n\nAnd no , a movie does not need a big budget or CGI special effects to be    scary or creepy .^\n\nActually the less the better ( see the equally awful remake    of The Haunting ) .^\n\nBut you have to do SOMETHING .^\n\nYou cant just count on us    all having nostalgic memories of how something like this COULD BE SCARY , if    it were real .^\n\nAnd by the way , about the shakycam filming in Blair Witch .   ^\n\nAre n\'t  these supposed to be \" filmmakers \" who should know how to point a    camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly ?^\n\nI \'m  not    even  talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified , that \'s     justified .^\n\nI \'m  talking about the otherminutes of the movie where they ca n\'t     seem to shoot anything smoothly at all .^\n\nMinor quibble there .    ^\n\nThere is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers .   ^\n\nThat the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the    bank .^\n\nAnd I think there is a good chance they will see this film again and    say to themselves \" what was I thinking ?

cv800_13494.txt,'There were four movies that earned Jamie Lee Curtis the title  of  \" scream queen  \" in the early \' 80s .  ^\n\nTwo of them were HALLOWEEN  movies  , but the other two --   PROM NIGHT and TERROR TRAIN --   were the  uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of HALLOWEEN .   ^\n\nThe same  \" God  , I \'m   scared  , there \'s   some guy in a mask coming after  me  \" routine she did in John Carpenter \'s   classic  , Jamie Lee copies here  ,  with none of the urgency or suspense .          ^\n\nTERROR TRAIN takes place on ( where else  ?  ) a train  , charted by  some pre-med students finishing their first four years of higher  education .  ^\n\nMost of them wo n\'t   make it to med school  , though  , and it \'s    obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains  ,   \" I wish to hell they \'d   put a radio on that train .  \"  ^\n\nThe conductor  character probably has the most lines of anyone  , even Jamie Lee .  ^\n\nFrom  the beginning  , he \'s   talking his head off ( He tells one of his co-workers   \" Think on this --   when \'s   the last time someone built a shopping mall  next to a train station  ?  \" as if it makes any kind of sense  ) and it only  gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of  railroad over recreational vehicles .  ^\n\nOf course  , the loudmouth  conductor is the first person to find a bloody body  , which is then gone  when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it .          ^\n\nI forgot to mention the prologue .  ^\n\nIt \'s   a party three years  earlier  , with the same group of students .  ^\n\nTwo of them play a trick on a  geeky frat pledge  , promising him he \'s   going to get laid .  ^\n\nThey send  Jamie Lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes  in  , noticing a form on the bed .  ^\n\nShe says  ,  \" Kiss me  , Kenny  ,  \" and he  kisses the body on the bed  , which happens to be a cadaver .  ^\n\n(  \" Oh my  God  , they killed Kenny  !  ^\n\nYou bastards  !  \"  )  ^\n\nIt \'s   a sick trick  , and one  Jamie Lee was n\'t   let in on .  ^\n\nShe still has n\'t   forgiven the guy as they  board the terror train (  \" You asshole  , you ca n\'t   have a good time  without hurting somebody  !  \"  ) .          ^\n\nThe killing starts before the train even leaves the station .   ^\n\nSince it \'s   New Year \'s    , everyone \'s   wearing disguises ( a convenient plot  device we \'ve   seen before  )  , and someone stabs the guy in the Groucho  mask when no one \'s   looking .  ^\n\nAt least one of the characters says it \'s   a  Groucho mask  ; when the killer dons it and steps aboard  , it looks like  Gene Shalit who  , by the way  , would make a great killer in a slasher  movie .  ^\n\nSpeaking of weird-looking dorks who still persist on the  entertainment scene  , one of TERROR TRAIN \'s   most famous gimmicks is  the appearance of David Copperfield  \" as The Magician  ,  \" who regails  those aboard with illusions set to disco music .  ^\n\nThen there \'s   his greatest  trick --   getting laid with hair that looks like that .          ^\n\nFor all its attempts at visual style and substance  , TERROR TRAIN  is more Lionel than Amtrak  , more PROM NIGHT than HALLOWEEN  , and  nothing really worth watching .  ^\n\nOnly die-hard fans of Jamie Lee Curtis  and David Copperfield ( if he truly has any fans  ) should even attempt  to watch it .  ^\n\nAnd it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an RV  could be much worse .  ^\n\nI mean  , when was the last time someone built a  shopping mall next to a train station  , anyway  ?  ^\n\nTERROR TRAIN is  definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car .

cv801_26335.txt,'According  to Hitchcock and various other filmmakers, isolated motels,    diners, gas stations and similar establishments in American Southwest can be    rather dangerous place for weary travellers.^\n\nAt the beginning of EYE OF THE    STORM , 1991 German- American thriller directed by Yuri Zeltser , one of such    places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up .   ^\n\nTen years later their son Steven ( played by Bradley Gregg ) , who was blinded    during the incident , still runs motel together with his older brother Ray    ( played by Craig Sheffer ) .^\n\nHardly anything happens there until alcoholic and    abusive William Gladstone ( played by Dennis Hopper ) gets stranded there with    his attractive wife Sandra ( played by Lara Flynn Boyle ) .^\n\nTheir unexpected    presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed .    ^\n\nYuri Zeltser , author of this film , was obviously inspired by Hitchcock \'s     PSYCHO , but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to    the original plot .^\n\nInstead of Norman Bates we have two brothers - one of    them  traumatised physically , another mentally .^\n\nSexual tension between    beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence    of alcoholic husband .^\n\nEYE OF THE STORM is impressive in visual sense , with    photography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic    atmosphere .^\n\nThe acting is fine - Hopper , Gregg and Boyle are comfortable    with  their  roles ,  but Sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine .   ^\n\nUnfortunately ,  EYE  OF  THE  STORM ,  which was supposed to be intense    psychological drama , deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick    during melodramatic finale .^\n\nIn the end , this film reminds us that original    approach ca n\'t  prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities .    ^\n\n( Special note to the PROFILER fans : Ally Walker appears in the beginning of    the film in the small role of killer \'s  girlfriend . )    ^\n\nFilmske    recenzije    na   hrvatskom/Movie   Reviews   in   Croatian    http://film.purger.com '

cv803_8584.txt,'DREAM WITH THE FISHES  ^\n\nIt \'s   rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of Finn Taylor \'s   first feature film  , DREAM WITH THE FISHES  , when the plodding  , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup .   ^\n\nAny hopeful expectations  , however  , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film \'s   latter half .  ^\n\nThe film \'s   central characters are Terry ( David Arquette  )  , a depressed  , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident  , and Nick ( Brad Hunt  )  , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill .   ^\n\nNick lives in the apartment building across from Terry  , who spies on the trysts between Nick and girlfriend Liz ( Kathryn Erbe  ) with his trusty set of binoculars  , but the two young men first formally meet at the Bay Bridge where a half-drunk Terry precariously teeters upon the edge  , unconvincingly vowing suicide .   ^\n\nNick casually asks for Terry \'s   wristwatch  , and eventually cons Terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills .   ^\n\nOf course  , Terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects  , and he angrily sets out to find Nick in order to retrieve his watch .   ^\n\nLearning of Nick \'s   condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left  )  , Terry \'s   compassion kicks in  , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - Terry will agree to bankroll the dying Nick \'s   lifelong fantasies  , and Nick will fulfill Terry \'s   death wish by killing him .  ^\n\nThis is a promising premise  , and Mr. Taylor \'s   film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point  , but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( Terry is a repessed  , mournful character who wants to die  , while Nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live  ) and takes the easy route out by turning DREAM WITH THE FISHES into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits  , and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character .   ^\n\nThis is by-the-numbers plotting  , buddy movie/road movie redux .  ^\n\nHowever  , DREAM WITH THE FISHES is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline  , but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic  , if not likeable .   ^\n\nUnfortunately  , that is not the case here  , where both of the film \'s   leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying  , giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights  , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits .   ^\n\nFar from a romp  , this fatal flaw makes DREAM WITH FISHES more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt  , and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond .  ^\n\nMr. Taylor \'s   dialogue sporadically falls flat in DREAM WITH THE FISHES - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone  , it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as  \" You should have asked something more interesting  , like \' Do you enjoy the pain  ? \' - See  , that \'s   provocative  , leaves room for further questions .  \"  )   ^\n\nThe film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene  , a session of nude bowling  , the policeman joining in on Terry and Nick \'s   acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between  , and for the most part the humour in DREAM WITH THE FISHES registers more as attempts rather than actual successes .  ^\n\nThis occurs particularly often during the film \'s   opening sequence - as Terry is wrestling the bedridden Nick for his watch in the hospital  , I \'m   realising that this is *intended* to be funny  , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it \'s   painfully clear to the audience from the outset that Terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts  , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from Nick \'s   scheme of tricking him  ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes .   ^\n\nThe entire sequence is  , then  , clearly an exercise for character exposition  , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability .  ^\n\nAmong the cast  , coming off best is David Arquette  , the current master in the portrayal of meek  , squirming  , stammering fresh-faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for George Huang \'s   SWIMMING WITH SHARKS - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as Terry .  ^\n\nMr. Taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique  , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated  , as opposed to a bright  , crisp look for the smalltown scenes .  ^\n\nThe charge of DREAM WITH THE FISHES \'s   protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me  ; I seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters  , and indeed  , in many cases have I been in the minority  , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult  , audience-unfriendly nature of their characters .  ^\n\nFor DREAM WITH THE FISHES  , though  , I did find myself on the flip side of coin  , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude  , and that the Nick character would just hurry up and die  .'

Marlowe Directed by Peter Hyams Rated R     And I thought \" Stigmata \" would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller    released this year .^\n\nTurns out I was wrong , because while \" Stigmata \" was    merely boring and self-important , \" End of Days \" is completely inept on all    fronts .^\n\nIt \'s  a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess .^\n\nFor a guy    like  me  who grew up watching Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best , it \'s     extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up .^\n\nFor the first    time in recent memory , an Arnold action movie ( and \" Batman & Robin \" does n\'t     count ) is no fun at all .^\n\n\" End of Days \" is a major stinker .    ^\n\nThe movie opens in Vatican City , 1979 .^\n\nSome Catholic priests have observed    an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that    Satan will have targeted for impregnation .^\n\nIf he impregnates her between 11    and midnight on December 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed .^\n\nThe pope    orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be    killed . ^\n\nIn  New  York , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the    prophecy .^\n\nTwenty years later , we meet Jericho Cane ( Schwarzenegger ) , a    suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem .^\n\nNow working as a security guard for    hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( Gabriel Byrne ) , who is actually    possessed by the devil .^\n\nAn assassination attempt on the businessman by a    crazed former priest leads him to the girl Satan is after , Christine York    ( Robin  Tunney ) . ^\n\nRecognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in    Christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , Jericho    swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking    to kill her .    ^\n\nThere are so many problems with this film it \'s  hard to know where to begin ,    but how about starting with the concept ?^\n\nCasting Arnold in a role like this    was a mistake to begin with .^\n\nSchwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so    putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad    idea .^\n\nArnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull    off a character tormented by conflicting emotions .^\n\nIn other words , trying to    give him dimension was a mistake .^\n\nHarrison Ford , Mel Gibson , or even Bruce    Willis could have played this role ( they \'ve  all played noble and flawed    heroes ) , but not Schwarzenegger .^\n\nThere are several scenes that attempt to    establish Jericho \'s  character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another    crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the    devil tries to tempt him into revealing Christine \'s  location by offering him    his old life back .^\n\nNone of these scenes really work , because Arnie is n\'t  up    to the task .^\n\nThe filmmakers would have been better off making Jericho a    strong , confident character ( like the Terminator , for example ) , the likes of    which  Schwarzenegger  has  excelled  in before .^\n\nThis one is n\'t  at all    believable the way Arnold plays him .    ^\n\nThe supporting cast tries their hardest , and only Gabriel Byrne makes any    impact at all .^\n\nAs the Prince of Darkness , he \'s  suave and confident .^\n\nHe acts    like one would expect the devil to act .^\n\nThe problem is that the script has    him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines    him as a powerful villain .^\n\nByrne out-performs Arnold in every scene they    have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is    problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root    for the devil .^\n\nByrne \'s  speech about the Bible being \" overrated \" actually    starts  to make sense , mainly because Arnold \'s  attempts at refuting it    ( mostly of the \" \'tis not ! \" variety ) are feeble at best .^\n\nThe only problem is ,    Arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares .^\n\nKevin Pollack plays    Jericho \'s  security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some    comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after    about an hour .^\n\nRobin Tunney is n\'t  given much to do except look scared .^\n\nIn    fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for    Byrne , is given anything interesting to do .    ^\n\nPerformances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who    starred in it .^\n\nThis being an action blockbuster , it \'s  no surprise that the    worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and    when  some  of  it  is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it \'s  utterly    ridiculous .^\n\nWhy is the devil coming on New Year \'s  Eve , 1999 ?^\n\nBecause it \'s     exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which is n\'t  666 , it turns    out .^\n\nSome nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is    999 , so just add ato the beginning , and you \'ve  got 1999 !^\n\nIf you do n\'t  buy    this explanation , you \'re  not alone .^\n\nIt \'s  convoluted and silly at the same    time . ^\n\nThe  method  by which Jericho locates Christine York is equally    ludicrous ( she \'s  Christine , see , and she lives in New York , see . . . ) , and    if that were n\'t  bad enough , there \'s  plenty of bothersome stuff in this film    that is n\'t  explained at all .^\n\nWhy can Satan kill everyone he passes on the    street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he \'s  powerless ?   ^\n\nIs he impervious to only one kind of bullet ?^\n\nHow come he ca n\'t  control    Jericho or Christine ?^\n\nAnd how did those Gregorian monks deal with time zones    in their prophecies ?^\n\nA clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it \'s     never actually explained .    ^\n\nUsually , this sort of thing would n\'t  matter in a Schwarzenegger flick ( I    mean ,  do n\'t   get  me  started on the time paradoxes offered up by the    Terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even    more than usual because the action is rarely exciting .^\n\nThere are several    predictable horror film clichs present in \" End of Days , \" complete with the    old \" black cat hiding in a cabinet \" bit , not that we ever find out what the    cat was doing in there .^\n\nIt gets so formulaic that it \'s  possible for those    uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a    \" boo \" will come .^\n\nTheir predictions will rarely be wrong .^\n\nThe more grandiose    action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we do n\'t  care    about  these  characters  ( due  to  the  script \'s  pathetic attempts at    characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , do n\'t  make any    sense .^\n\nThere \'s  a scene where Schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a    little old lady .^\n\nIt \'s  good for a few chuckles , but not much else .^\n\nSupposedly    we \'re  to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by    Satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly .^\n\nNone    of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly    framed that it \'s  often hard to tell why it \'s  happening in the first place ,    not to mention that they \'re  edited in full-on incomprehensible MTV quick-cut    style .^\n\nMost of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , \" Wow ,    cool ! \"    ^\n\n\" End of Days \" is not only silly and confusing , but it \'s  also distinctly    unpleasant  to watch .^\n\nThe devil apparently does n\'t  operate in the more    subtle , I\'ll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the    Bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight .^\n\nThis    does n\'t  only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that    not a single scene in \" End of Days \" goes by without unnecessarily graphic    violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me    scratching my head ) .^\n\nIf violence is supposed to be shocking , it \'s  not a good    idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb .^\n\nScenes    are n\'t  connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff    gets blown up , or people get killed , and I had no idea why .^\n\nReasons ?^\n\nTo hell    with reasons !^\n\nLet \'s  just blow stuff up !^\n\nIs n\'t  it cool ?^\n\nNope , not by a long    shot .    ^\n\nThis  film  is  thoroughly  unwatchable . ^\n\nIt \'s  dull , interminable , and    unrelenting in its stupidity .^\n\nPerhaps Arnold needs to make some movies with    James Cameron to revive his career , because it \'s  not happening with hack    Peter Hyams here .^\n\n\" End of Days \" might have had camp value , if only it did n\'t     top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody \'s  going to buy .^\n\nIf    the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a    decent script .^\n\nIf it \'s  going to be campy , Arnold should n\'t  be taking himself    so damn seriously ( I did n\'t  actually see him put up on a cross , did I ? ) , and    his character should n\'t  be such a sad sack .^\n\nAs it stands , \" End of Days \" is    just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that .    ^'

cv811_22646.txt,'Starring Liam Neeson; Catherine Zeta-Jones; Owen Wilson; Lili Taylor & Bruce    Dern     When The Haunting arrived in theaters, all I kept hearing about was the    overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in    the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a    face to courtesy of special effects.^\n\nWhile I agree that this remake of The    Haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , I do n\'t     think that they are completely to blame for this movie \'s  failure .^\n\nIt appears    that some people

 ^\n\nAnd let \'s  face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so    because of Zeta-Jones .^\n\nI \'ll  admit that I would have never seen this thing if    she were n\'t  in it .    ^\n\nBut the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly    overdone sets .^\n\nThey take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the    house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients .^\n\nThere really    is n\'t  much of a story here .^\n\nJust endless setups so director Jan de Bont can    showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with .^\n\nAnd the    special effects are great .^\n\nIn many cases they are as good as you are likely    to see anywhere .^\n\nIn other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in    just for the sake of hitting the \" cool shots \" quota .^\n\nAt no point in the    movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary --  funny , maybe .   ^\n\nBut not scary .^\n\nThen we have the set .^\n\nWhen I first saw the house , I was very    impressed with the very cool gothic look about it .^\n\nBut it only took a short    tour  by the characters around the place to see that the set designers    obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and    decided to take the idiotically overdone route .^\n\nThis included a flooded    hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that    revolves .^\n\nWhat part did these rooms play in the story ?^\n\nAbsolutely none .^\n\nThey    were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a    descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie .    ^\n\nThen we have the actors .^\n\nLili Taylor has never been one of my favorites .^\n\nAnd    when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she    comes in around the average or slightly below mark .^\n\nI have no idea why Liam    Neeson took this role .^\n\nHe basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out    of control circus .^\n\nHis character was in charge of this farce but it quickly    got away from him .^\n\nI have no doubt that Liam will want to lock all prints of    this  movie  in  a very secure vault along with all copies of Darkman .   ^\n\nZeta-Jones was cast because she is too hot for words .^\n\nThe fact that her    character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake .^\n\nAll Catherine has to do in    this movie is look good .^\n\nFortunately that is something she does very well .   ^\n\nWhile she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only    purpose in the movie was as eye-candy .^\n\nIt \'s  too bad someone of her talents    wasted them here .^\n\nAny random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could    have easily filled her role .    ^\n\nThe Haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999\'s  horror movies , The Blair    Witch Project .^\n\nThe Haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while    Blair Witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares .^\n\nBoth prove quite nicely    that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film .^\n\nIf the story sucks ,    it \'s  all downhill from there .^\n\nMy advice ?^\n\nIf you are looking for special    effects , go rent Star Wars .^\n\nIf it \'s  scares you want , rent Halloween .^\n\nEither    way , it \'s  probably in your best interests to skip The Haunting .

cv813_6649.txt,'I am a Steven Seagal fan .  ^\n\nI only say this now because  \" Mufti Splenetik  \" is n\'t   my real name and because I probably need to explain why I went into this film expecting great things .  ^\n\nAny proud Seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the Seagal formula is something you can depend on .  ^\n\nSeagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue  , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we \'ll   always hear when Seagal does his limb-twisting thing  )  , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it \'s   a real-life model-wife who has n\'t   worked since WEIRD SCIENCE  ) and  , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine .  ^\n\nNot to mention very straightforward plots  , generally all-round bad dialogue and Mr Implacable Leather-Face himself in that same black outfit he \'s   been in since NICO doing his  \" my hands are sharp  , nimble knives  \" thing  , Seagal the Stoic  , Sir Petrified Ponytail  , Duke of Dull .  ^\n\nIn THE GLIMMER MAN  , Seagal breaks out of this formula  : he gets a *sidekick*  , attempts to banter  , and puts on a new vest .  ^\n\nHe \'s   also put on quite a lot of weight .  ^\n\nSmall potatoes  , you may say  , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to  , but damnit  , if it ai n\'t   broke  , why fix it  ? ( more on this disappointed person \'s   dashed expectations later  ) .  ^\n\nAs Jack Cole  , Seagal is a homicide detective with a Questionable Past .  ^\n\nWhile he and his partner ( played by Keenen Ivory Wayans  ) are investigating a series of ritual killings  , Cole himself becomes a suspect  , especially when a background check run by Campbell reveals practically nothing on Cole .  ^\n\nIt turns out that Cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just ca n\'t   trust these homicide detectives  )  , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them  , and hence  , well  , you know  , that  \" glimmer man  \" thing .  ^\n\nAn increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger  , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( Bob Gunton  )  , Cole \'s   former CIA boss ( Brian Cox  ) and deals involving chemical weapons .  ^\n\nTHE GLIMMER MAN plot is pretty standard stuff  , drawing ( as with his other films  ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg  , SE7EN  ) .  ^\n\nIt \'s   the other changes that disappoint .  ^\n\nFor example  , although there \'s   a fair amount of violence in this movie  , there \'s   also the disastrous pairing of Seagal with Keenen Ivory Wayans  , probably the best known of the Wayans tribe ( how many are there  , exactly  ?  ) from television \'s    \" In Living Colour .  \"  ^\n\nWayans plays whiney straightman to Seagal \'s   bead-adorned and brocade-draped Cole  , keeping up his  \" are you crazy  \" part of the dialogue with wasted zest .  ^\n\nAs Campbell  , Wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner \'s   eccentric habits  , but the chemistry between the two is minimal  , and Seagal \'s   wooden comebacks make for painful watching .  ^\n\nA cook in UNDER SEIGE 2  , Seagal is now a Buddhist who speaks Chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble .  ^\n\nHe chants  , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces Campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies .  ^\n\nAgain  , a benign ( if trite  ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require Seagal to speak more than usual .  ^\n\nHeck  , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film .  ^\n\nIs that a lot to ask of the Seague  ?  ^\n\nToo much .  ^\n\nSeagal \'s   best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies  : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages  , and to do it silently  , and alone .  ^\n\nNot for Seagal  , the snappy one-liners of Arnold and Stallone  , nor the attempts to show that he can act  , much less think .  ^\n\nNo KINDERGARTEN COP  , no OSCAR  , just simple  , unadulterated deathblows .  ^\n\nThat \'s   really how it must have started  : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch The Seague do his thing  , knowing that never in the Seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else .  ^\n\nWe trusted him .  ^\n\nWe got to know him .  ^\n\nNow  ,  betrayal .  ^\n\nI do n\'t   know if I can watch another Seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he \'s   going to try to be funny again .  ^\n\nI \'ll   try  , but it wo n\'t   be easy .  ^\n\nIf you have n\'t   watched THE GLIMMER MAN yet  , you might want to wait for the video to come out .  ^\n\nIt \'s   easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences .  ^\n\nAfter all  , if we ca n\'t   depend on our fantasies  , what can we depend on  ?  ^\n\nMufti Spelenetik is still a Steven Seagal fan .  ^\n\nEverybody makes mistakes once in awhile .

unfunny    cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ;    the   end   result   is ,  unsurprisingly ,  an  unfunny ,  uninsightful ,    cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment .    ^\n\nGarry Shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically    advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of    course )

trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if    they \'d  never seen a woman before .^\n\nThe few guys that are n\'t  particularly    slimeballs ,  such  as  John  Goodman \'s  detective

thankfully , never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition .^\n\nInstead , it    just dangles limply on the branch for a while , withers , and falls away .   ^\n\nFurther proof that Goodman should just stick to doing Coen Brothers movies .    ^\n\nBut let \'s  not dwell on this any longer , I \'ve  already wasted plenty of your    time and my own .^\n\nLet \'s  move on , forget about what we

cv820_24157.txt,'` The Skulls  \' is a laughably bad thriller  , a teen-orientated doppelganger of ` The Firm \' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor .  ^\n\nCertain moments are so preposterous that I nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter .  ^\n\nI chuckled incessantly  , all the way home .  ^\n\nLet me share .  ^\n\nThe Skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of Yale ( designed  , I \'m   sure  , to mirror the actual Skull & Bones from the same college  ) .  ^\n\nLuke McNamara ( Joshua Jackson  )  , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year  , highlights the latest Skull scouting report .  ^\n\nDespite some anxiety and caution from others  , Luke accepts entry into the organization .  ^\n\nSoon after  , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women  , driving a new car and marveling at the $ 20  , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account .  ^\n\nYeah  , dude  , pretty good deal eh  ?  ^\n\nBut Luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating  ; when circumstances become extreme  , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable .  ^\n\nThe premise  , although lacking in originality  , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , ` The Skulls  \' is neither intriguing  , nor suspenseful  , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting .  ^\n\nIt \'s   just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack  , the stars   .... but not the script .  ^\n\n` The Skulls  \' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value  , with the screenplay  , by Jon Pogue  , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers  .  ^\n\nFirst off  , upon their initiation into The Skulls  , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm .  ^\n\nAfterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar .  ^\n\nWill they never take this watch off  ?  ^\n\nAnd what if they forget it by their bedside  ?  ^\n\nPerhaps their secret \' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed .  ^\n\nOn top of this  , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters .  ^\n\nGee  , why not member T-shirts  ?  ^\n\nBut my favorite bit is this  : the voting committee for The Skulls does not bother with individual agree \' or disagree \' notions when making collective decisions .  ^\n\nThey are given official Skull paddles .  ^\n\nWhen flipped to one side  , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal .  ^\n\nFacing the opposite way means a disagreement .  ^\n\nWould n\'t   they merely express themselves verbally  ?  ^\n\nHell no. They have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote  , and maybe afterward they can play Ping-Pong .  ^\n\nI \'m   still chuckling about these ludicrous details  , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest .  ^\n\nThe cast  , meanwhile  , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the ` Dawson \'s   Creek \' crowd  , and fuses the two together  , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout .  ^\n\nBut not entirely .  ^\n\nAccomplished actors like Craig T. Nelson ( as Skulls chairman Judge Litten Mandrake  ) and William Peterson ( as fellow board member Senator Levritt  ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures  , and look suitably embarrassed handling them .  ^\n\nAnd then there \'s   Christopher McDonald  , who has the capacity to be a fun  , exciting actor .  ^\n\nMcDonald \'s   charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes  , Pogue makes it a hat-trick  ) .  ^\n\nI pray it was a ` snatch-the-paycheck-and-run \' exercise for all these actors .  ^\n\nThe young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better .  ^\n\nLet \'s   cut the talented Canadian lad Joshua Jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character .  ^\n\nPaul Walker  , the strapping quarterback from ` Varsity Blues  \'  , is bland but passable as Caleb Mandrake - the Judge \'s   son .  ^\n\nWalker preserves a straight face  , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( ` Dad  , I just killed a guy in the ritual room  ! \'  ) .  ^\n\nSome actual spark is generated by Leslie Bibb  , who plays Luke \'s   longtime chum Chloe  , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics .  ^\n\nIt really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one .  ^\n\nOr maybe not minute one  , thanks to a decent set-up from director Rob Cohen  , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style .  ^\n\nIt makes you wonder why he did n\'t   flee indefinitely from the project  , because while enjoyable cheese like ` Dragonheart \' and the moderate Stallone thriller ` Daylight \' are n\'t   superior cinema  , they belong on the AFI Top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash .  ^\n\nAside from unintentionally humoring the audience  , ` The Skulls  \' gets little accomplished .  ^\n\nThe thrills and action are lazy and mechanical .  ^\n\nThe story is stuffed with ridiculous  , formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick .  ^\n\nInstead of gaining knowledge about The Skulls as an organization  , we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage .  ^\n\nWe \'ve   seen it all before  , and better .  ^\n\n` The Skulls  \' is a feeble little circus of stupidity  , so miscalculated that --   while it would serve as a clever pun --   a term like boneheaded \' seems just too generous .

cv826_12761.txt,'Starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro     Written by Alex Cox, Tod Davies, Terry Gilliam and Tony Grisoni     I\'ve always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid.^\n\nDropping acid is like    riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and    valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach    into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last .^\n\nThen there \'s  the    hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a    strychnine-laced dose .^\n\nMushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic    equivalent of a leisurely ride on a Ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring    assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth    landing .^\n\nAcid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy .    ^\n\nMy point is that in FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS , director Terry Gilliam    has made an acid movie , when I wish he would have made a mushroom movie .   ^\n\nFull  of  shocking  sight  gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic    performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of Hunter    S.  Thompson \'s  book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological    world-view from the inside out .^\n\nBut for those of us who just want to enjoy a    well-made film , Gilliam has produced a mixed bag .    ^\n\nFEAR AND LOATHING tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed    \" gonzo \" journalist Hunter S. Thompson ( Johnny Depp ) and Hispanic activist    attorney Oscar Zeta Actosta ( Benicio Del Toro ) , came to Las Vegas to cover a    motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a District    Attorney \'s  convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a    man of means in 1971 .^\n\nOperating under the pseudonyms of \" Raoul Duke \" and    \" Dr. Gonzo \" , the two men careen into Vegas on an acid and mescaline bender ,    then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and    a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers .^\n\nThey terrorize every one they    meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them .^\n\nDuke hallucinates    giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in    the casino lounge .^\n\nDr. Gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting    knife and begs Duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just    as Jefferson Airplane \'s  \" White Rabbit \" reaches its climax .^\n\nAnd these guys    do n\'t  just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them    for dead .^\n\nThat neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind    luck or Providence , depending on your point of view .    ^\n\nThompson \'s  book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time    as an important historical document .^\n\nIt simultaneously exposed the 60\'s  drug    culture for the sham that it was and exposed Las Vegas as the place where    the American Dream came to die .^\n\nPontificate all you want about how the film    illustrates Thompson \'s  message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare    essentials , what Gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy .^\n\nIt \'s  a Cheech and    Chong  movie . ^\n\nYou \'re  there to watch Depp and del Toro ingest a lot of    chemicals and then laugh at the results : see Johnny take drugs , see Johnny    fall down .    ^\n\nThere \'s  nothing wrong with this concept , but Gilliam tries too hard .^\n\nThis is    a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , Dutch tilts and    other-worldly lighting schemes .^\n\nThere are times when Gilliam really does put    a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen .^\n\nBut to what end ?   ^\n\nMuch of the dialogue comes verbatim from Thompson \'s  book , and there are some    priceless comic observations .^\n\nBut you \'re  hard pressed to hear or digest them    amidst all the jumbled camera work .^\n\nThis brings us to the performances ,    which strike me as all wrong .^\n\nDepp plays Thompson as Groucho Marks filtered    through George C. Scott in PATTON - a gimmicky performance which works    against the biting satire of Thompson \'s  dialogue .^\n\nIn between his several    puking scenes , Del Toro fares better as Dr. Gonzo , but he also mumbles and    sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost .^\n\nWatching these two    made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with Dan Akroyd    and John Belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see .    ^\n\nIt \'s  interesting to note that Alex Cox , credited as a co-writer on the    screenplay , was originally slated to direct before Gilliam took over .^\n\nAs    much of a fan as I am of Gilliam \'s  work , Cox would have been the better    choice .^\n\nSID AND NANCY , Cox \'s  best work , covered essentially the same subject    matter ,  but Cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of Sid    Vicious and Nancy Spungen to carry the film .^\n\nGilliam commits the compound    sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose .^\n\nWhat    kind  of  movie  was he trying to make , anyway ?^\n\nIt does n\'t  try to be a    cautionary tale , and it does n\'t  work as broad comedy .^\n\nIf he had considered    more  carefully  his  purpose ,  the result would have been a much more    interesting film .^\n\nBut I do n\'t  want to be too hard on it .^\n\nThere are some    truly funny moments , and if you \'re  in a good enough mood you might get a    kick out of it .^\n\nI do , however , recommend watching FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS    VEGAS  under  the  influence of your favorite controlled substance - I    guarantee it will enhance the effect .    ^\n\nPlease visit the Film Geek web site at : '

cv831_16325.txt,'One of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director  Sidney Lumet \'s    \" Gloria  ,  \" a remake of the 1980 John Cassavetes film  , had  absolutely no effect on me occurred when I was driving home from the  theatre .  ^\n\nSuddenly  , I realized that since I had stood up from my theatre  seat five minutes before  , I had not thought once about the film I had  just invested nearly two hours of my life in .  ^\n\nWhen a movie is over  ,  are n\'t   we supposed to think about it for a while  , and have a  conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it  with  ?  ^\n\nI thought so  , but  , for one  , I saw this particular picture by  myself  , and #2  , even if I had been with someone there would n\'t   have been  anything to talk about in the first place .  ^\n\nTo be sure  ,  \" Gloria  \" begins with a stirring  , rather poignant prologue in  which a seven-year-old boy \'s   family is brutally gunned down by mobsters  ,  in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it .   ^\n\nRight before the men broke in  , of course  , his father gave him the disc  to escape with .  ^\n\nEventually  , the boy  , named Nicky Nunez ( Jean-Luke  Figueroa  )  , is caught by the mobsters  , and taken back to their apartment .  ^\n\nMeanwhile  , Gloria ( Sharon Stone  ) has just gotten out of prison for a  crime she did n\'t   commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( Jeremy Northam  )  to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime .  ^\n\nWhen he  refuses to give it to her  , and then hears the group of men talking about  killing Nicky  , she leaves with him in order to save his life  , but not  before holding the men at gunpoint  , stealing all of their money  , and  forcing them to strip nude .  ^\n\nGloria is the type of fast-talking  ,  smart-mouthed New Yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong  people  , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid  , but she has a  heart of gold ( do n\'t   they always in this type of movie  ) and is only  trying to protect the boy  , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond  with .  ^\n\nThe previous incarnation of  \" Gloria  \" by Cassavetes and starring the  luminous Gena Rowlands  , remains unseen by me  , but was no doubt superior  ,  even though I ca n\'t   really imagine how this considerably dull story  could be transformed into an entertaining one  , regardless of the  director or stars .  ^\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that director Lumet has  stuck closely to the original  , but the film itself is simply lifeless  ,  with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it is n\'t    completely unbearable to watch .  ^\n\nI liked  , for example  , a very funny  climactic sequence where Gloria is deciding whether to leave the school  she has left the boy at  , and keeps turning the car around  , then driving  a little ways  , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again .   ^\n\nThese bright moments  , however  , appear long and far between  , and the  majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between Nicky  and Gloria  , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers .   ^\n\nThroughout  , my mind was repeatedly asking the question  ,  \" who really  cares  ?  \"  ^\n\nAs Gloria  , Sharon Stone has adopted an over-the-top Brooklyn accent that  honestly does n\'t   sound realistic at all .  ^\n\nIn the beginning  , in fact  , I  was amazed at how amateurish Stone \'s   performance was  , but as the film  progressed she got better .  ^\n\nAlthough not one of her better turns  , Stone  does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored .  ^\n\nJean-Luke Figeroa  was fine as Nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors  who are so precocious they make you want to gag .  ^\n\nAll other actors who  appeared were considerably wasted  , none more than Cathy Moriarty  , an  entertaining actress in her own right  , who is billed fourth and has all  of one scene  , as Gloria \'s   friend whom she turns to for help .   ^\n\nSony  , the studio that released  \" Gloria  ,  \" obviously does not have any  faith in the film  , and I do n\'t   blame them .  ^\n\nThey declined to screen the  picture for critics  , which is never a good sign  , particularly with the  high-profile people involved .  ^\n\nAlthough how much money a movie makes does  not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular  \" In Dreams  ,  \"  which failed to even make the Top 10 last week  )  , I have a suspicion   \" Gloria  \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than  \" Ishtar  ,  \" judging  from the opening night 7:00 p.m. showing I saw it at  , where there were  about ten to fifteen people present  , counting myself .  ^\n\nAlthough Stone can  be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995 \'s    \" Casino  \" or 1996 \'s     \" Last Dance  \" if you do n\'t   believe me  ) and Sidney Lumet can be a  respectable director  , there is no reasoning for why they thought the  cliched story of  \" Gloria  \" was worth remaking or  , for that matter  , why  Columbia Pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making  a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance  to be successful  .'

  ^\n\nAnd yes that is as complex as this movie \'s  observations get .^\n\nThe characters    are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more .    ^\n\nThe plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for    carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events .^\n\nWe    meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their    idiotic ruminations on intimacy .^\n\nI would normally go into the characters and    the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film I    cannot .^\n\nI \'m  not trying to be clever or witty , but I honestly hardly remember    anything that would set them apart from the others .^\n\nWith the exception of    Trent ( played by Ron Livingston as a bargain basement Patrick Bateman ) , the    rest fade into each other --  a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly    white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin .^\n\nI vaguely recall Brad Rowe as the    sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( \" sex without    love equals violence \" ) .    ^\n\nIn  between  all the confessionals , Cristoffer films everything like a    headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning .^\n\nThe fact    that this director at one point won a Pulitzer Prize completely baffles me .   ^\n\nThis film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the    generation that its tag line claims to be defining .^\n\nIf BODY SHOTS is meant    to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and fk-obsessed , fine , I do n\'t     have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain    way , but Cristoffer only gives us one side .^\n\nAdditionally that one side is n\'t     even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of    sexiness .^\n\nOr realism .^\n\nOne sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a    chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters .^\n\nThey suddenly    have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than    that they both happen to be standing next to each otheralas , if it could    only be that easykidding of course ) , then , not only is n\'t  it erotic , it    is n\'t  real .^\n\nIt does n\'t  feel like an authentic sexual encounter .^\n\nEvery fk    scene  in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy    manner .^\n\nBODY SHOTS makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno    film .^\n\nIt shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and    most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much    if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it .    ^\n\nThe resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ) over one    night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow .^\n\nThe main concern    is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred .^\n\nThe film shows us    two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the    other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the    possible victim gets her shirt torn off .^\n\nThis is a topic that could be    interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me I    ca n\'t  think of one film that has done so , and yes I saw THE ACCUSED which    may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80\'s  next to WALL STREET .   ^\n\nUnfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director    or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a    noxious 90210 spin off .    ^\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson approached BOOGIE NIGHTS in a manner similar to what    Cristoffer does here , though BOOGIE NIGHTS succeeded .^\n\nIt was similarly    moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the    lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible    fall-out of such a decision .^\n\nThe characters in BOOGIE NIGHTS were as idiotic    as the characters are here , but Anderson seemed to care about them .^\n\nHe gave    them heart .^\n\nCristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones .^\n\nHe preaches    to us , by using his characters to preach to us .^\n\nThis is not the way to get    any message across .^\n\nWhy not just direct a public service announcement on the    perils of hittin\' skins ?^\n\nCristofer kind of does that , though without an    ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation.

cv833_11961.txt,'I\'m guessing -- and from the available evidence, it\'s not a great guess --    that  BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN began life as an insider satire of Hollywood    excess, stupidity, ego and power-mongering.^\n\nIf so , the film that ended up on    the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes    in film history .^\n\nIt has already been well-documented that the original    title , AN ALAN SMITHEE FILM , became a problem when miserable test screenings    forced re-cuts against the will of director Arthur Hiller , prompting Hiller    himself to opt for the Directors \' Guild-mandated pseudonym of Alan Smithee .   ^\n\nThat left a film satire in the hands of writer Joe Eszterhas , as humorless a    hack as ever put finger to word processor .^\n\nAnd you could just smell the    disaster brewing .    ^\n\nIf you \'re  unfortunate enough to sit through BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN , you \'ll     still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up .^\n\nOstensibly ,    it \'s  a pseudo-documentary account of a director named Alan Smithee ( Eric    Idle ) who loses control of a big-budget action film called TRIO starring    Sylvester Stallone , Whoopi Goldberg and Jackie Chan ( all of whom appear as    themselves ) .^\n\nWhen the only recourse available to him is abandoning the    project to be called \" An Alan Smithee Film \" --  which , of course , it already    is --  Smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it .   ^\n\nAmong the parties interviewed are the film \'s  producer James Edmunds ( Ryan    O\'Neal ) and studio boss Jerry Glover ( Richard Jeni ) , who spend virtually the    entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around    them .    ^\n\nIt \'s  bad enough that BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN has --  literally --  not a single    laugh for its entire , blissfully briefminutes .^\n\nWhat makes it even worse is    Eszterhas \' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or    even three times .^\n\nMichael Ovitz references , SHOWGIRLS references , oral sex    references , Whoopi Goldberg/Ted Danson references --  all show up multiple    times  with  all  the  subtlety that is Eszterhas \' stock-in-trade .^\n\nThe    reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency ,    notably with the hilarious use of the word \" feminist \" as an identifying    caption for every single female character in the film .^\n\nBy the time Coolio    and Chuck D show up as black independent film-makers the Brothers Brothers    ( cleverly identified as \" bad a --  \" and \" badder a --  \" , among other unprintable    things ) , you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over    your head to avoid being identified .    ^\n\nThose documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best    insight into what \'s  so hideously wrong with BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN .^\n\nNot content    to stick any Hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , Eszterhas    fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears .^\n\nThe    producer is a \" liar \" who \" slept in the White House ; \" the media are \" maggots \"    and  \" leeches \" working for publications like \" The New York Slimes \" and    \" Newsleak \" ( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you    do n\'t  miss the joke ) .^\n\nIt does n\'t  even matter that Eszterhas tags \" penile    implant \" after his own name when he makes a cameo , because it seems like    such a desperate attempt to feign self-deprecation .^\n\nThis is a petulant    schoolboy \'s   idea of satire --  pictures of Hollywood insiders to which    Eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth .    ^\n\nThe last stomach-churning straw comes when BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN closes with    out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much    fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half    of  your  life away .^\n\nPerhaps it was just a final , desperate attempt by    Eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film , or to    convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to    blow  their  whole career .^\n\nPity everyone involved with this excessive ,    ego-driven \" satire \" of excess and ego .^\n\nIt \'s  too bad that only directors can    remove their names from noxious material like this .^\n\nOtherwise , you might    have seen credits for BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN overflowing with Alan Smithees .

   ^\n\nHow could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of Meg Ryan , Lisa Kudrow ,    and Diane Keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ?^\n\nIssues from the    past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is    fleetingly brought up , but the film is n\'t  mature enough to deal with such a    thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their    childhood ,  it  is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an    afterthought .^\n\nAlso , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the    tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic    metamorphosizes . ^\n\nAnd  when they do reunite in the finale , their whole    consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in    which they argue like little children .^\n\nYou can see the impending death    coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that    the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other .   ^\n\nYou think to yourself : \" The only thing left for them to do is have a playful    food-fight , \" and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits .    ^\n\nMeg Ryan is a versatile actress ( look no further than 1998\'s  \" Hurlyburly \" or    1994\'s  \" When a Man Loves a Woman \" ) , despite her various detractors who    stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies .^\n\nWith \" Hanging Up , \"    the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with    Nora Ephron , a writer/director/hack who should n\'t  be allowed to work in    Hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle .^\n\nEven if she    knew  what  she  was  making  was not exactly up to par in the quality    department , she nonetheless is very good , and the two scenes that work ,    flashbacks to Christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her    mother , and to Halloween 1993 , when Lou crashed her son \'s  birthday party in    a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism Ryan brings to the    situations .    ^\n\nDiane Keaton , as Georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but    that is a wildly feeble compliment .^\n\nWhat is more than a little far-fetched    is that Keaton is distinctly older than Ryan and Kudrow , although in the    very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no more than five    years Ryan \'s  senior .^\n\nYeah , right .    ^\n\nLastly , poor Lisa Kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture ,    after her even more thin role in 1999\'s  \" Analyze This . \"^\n\nKudrow is n\'t  given    enough time to create a full personality with Maddy , so it is n\'t  her fault    she does n\'t  register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where    she is actually blessed with being given dialogue .^\n\nIf anything , though ,    Kudrow is a real talent , and I anxiously await the next time she is given a    role  more  deserving  of  her  time ,  as  in her brilliantly nuanced ,    Oscar-caliber work in 1998\'s  \" The Opposite of Sex . \"^\n\nIf you are a fan of    Kudrow \'s  ( and who is n\'t  ?

^\n\nIf , for some bizarre , \" Twilight Zone\"-type of reason , you find    yourself in a movie theater showing this film , my suggestion would be to    hang up on it before the opening credits are over .^\n\nSaying it is a waste of    time is an understatement of epic proportions .

cv838_25886.txt,'\" Modernization must die  \"  In our time .  ^\n\nIn our modern world  , where the cool rule  , it \'s   hard to imagine that Shakespeare is becoming \' the man \' .  ^\n\nAnd yet - film after film  , after film  , is based on his everlasting magic .  ^\n\nIn Warner Brothers  \' latest production  , Shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat  , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away .  ^\n\nThough the producers of The Matrix have vaguely based their picture on William Shakespeare \'s   \' Romeo And Juliet \'   , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of New York  , is very hard to associate with Shakespeare \'s   poetry .  ^\n\nThe film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the Afro Americans against the Chinese .  ^\n\nThe youngest son of a Chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered .  ^\n\nThe Afro-Americans are immediately suspected  , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers .  ^\n\nIt is at this point that Han ( the Romeo of the story  ) finds out about his brother \'s   death .  ^\n\nEscaping from a prison in China  , he returns to United States to avenge his brother \'s   fate .  ^\n\nBut before he can restore justice with his Kung Fu kicks  , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty .  ^\n\nThe only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy. .  ^\n\nThere \'s   only a weak echo of Shakespeare \'s   talent in this disappointing production .  ^\n\nAnd there are more problems besides its title .  ^\n\nOf course we do n\'t   call it a deformation of a great masterpiece .  ^\n\nWe call it \' modernization \' .  ^\n\nIt seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics  , without any car chases and gun fights .  ^\n\nThis lack of respect for the audience I find very disturbing .  ^\n\nKenneth Brannagh has already proven that Shakespeare does n\'t   need to be updated  , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature .  ^\n\nAnd as long as love  , hate  , honesty and corruption do exist  , everyone will understand and embrace Shakespeare .  ^\n\nI must admit that I found \' Rome Must Die \' very confusing .  ^\n\nI can forgive Andrzej Bartkowiak  , since it is his first attempt at directing .  ^\n\nHe manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision .  ^\n\nUnfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments .  ^\n\nHis latest picture is therefore visually impressive  , but intellectually hollow .  ^\n\nThe love story between Han ( Jet Li  ) and Trish ( Aalyah  )  , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified .  ^\n\nJet Li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and Aalyah has a magical voice .  ^\n\nTheir achievement save this film from being completely braindead  , but they are not actors  , and therefore can not act .  ^\n\nThey are nothing more than two celebrities put together .  ^\n\nThe other actors  , including Isaiah Washington  , Russell Wong  , Henry O and DMX all give the standard mediocre performances .  ^\n\nDelroy Lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality .  ^\n\nBut there \'s   more than acting to worry about .  ^\n\nEven with Li \'s   incredible skills in martial arts  , the action scenes ( though technically excellent  ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing .  ^\n\nTo make a long story short  : \' Romeo Must Die \' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller  , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film .  ^\n\nIt is certain that Bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to \' Romeo and Juliet \'  , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be .  ^\n\nAnd in the end it \'s   nothing .  ^\n\nThere are no performances worthy of notice  , no interesting character- or story surprises .  ^\n\nSo again  , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement .  ^\n\nThis film can boast of great sound  , fast paced editing  , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences .  ^\n\nThe music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre .  ^\n\nIt is mostly provided by Aalyah \'s   enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists  , that create a kind of \' ghetto feel \' to it .  ^\n\nBut when I think back  , it \'s   not much I remember from this \' production \' .  ^\n\nAs in almost every summer movie  , there are some interesting scenes  , but most of the moments that I remember are associated with massive special effects .  ^\n\nIt is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities  , simply because it does n\'t   have any .  ^\n\nFor someone who has never read Shakespeare  , it \'s   another popcorn film .  ^\n\nFor those of us who has  , it \'s   a waste of money  , time and brain cells  .'

\" you may ask .^\n\nWell , BLADE SQUAD is not really a movie so to speak but    ahour pilot for a possible TV series packaged as a movie .^\n\nBLADE SQUAD is    dumb . ^\n\nBLADE SQUAD is loud .^\n\nBLADE SQUAD is obnoxious .^\n\nBLADE SQUAD will    probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived TV series .^\n\nWhy not ?^\n\nAfter    all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars    ( \" Knight Rider \" ) , fast helicopters ( \" Airwolf \" ) , and super fast motorcycles    ( \" Street Hawk \" ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past .^\n\nSo , why not    crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ?    ^\n\nTo  be  honest , as a made-for-TV presentation , BLADE SQUAD is at least    watchable . ^\n\nThe  film  has  a  relatively  large cast of characters , a    surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action    sequences  to  keep one half-interested .^\n\nI \'d  imagine adolescent males ,    probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it .^\n\nI    tried to keep that in mind when I watched BLADE SQUAD .^\n\nI can remember liking    \" Airwolf \" and \" Street Hawk \" when I wasor 11 .^\n\nAnd , although this is n\'t  saying    much , BLADE SQUAD is leaps and bounds better than the last Fox network movie    I had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful GENERATION X    ( a  huge disappointment considering the comic book \'s  terrific two-year    beginning ) .^\n\nBut , I digress .    ^\n\nDespite its limited appeal , BLADE SQUAD has a lot of kinks to work out if    the movie is to become a TV series .^\n\nOne , it suffers from MTV syndrome : a lot    of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer \'s  senses while a    near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background .   ^\n\nOh yeah , Dylan \'s  \" Knockin\' on Heaven \'s  Door \" and Bowie \'s  \" I \'m  Afraid of    Americans \" are used here , in rather poor taste .^\n\nTwo , BLADE SQUAD needs a new    crew for the sound .^\n\nThe substandard sound editing irritated me to no end .   ^\n\nCharacters \' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible .^\n\nDuring    one  important  scene ,  a song played loudly in the background .^\n\nWhen a    character spoke , the song \'s  volume dropped but did not disappear .^\n\nAs soon as    that character finished speaking , the song \'s  volume immediately returned to    its original level until the next character spoke .^\n\nThis sounds trivial , I \'m     sure ,  but  it  distracted  me  immensely .^\n\nFinally , this is commercial    television . ^\n\nFoul  language  is  not allowed , typically , on commercial    television . ^\n\nThus , do n\'t  use foul language in a made-for-TV production    because that foul language has to be censored in some manner .^\n\nIn an early    scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor    confrontation in the streets .^\n\nWhen the good guy spouts out a bad word , a    driver conveniently honks his car \'s  horn off-screen to muffle the word out .   ^\n\nIn a \" Seinfeld \" episode , this technique proved funny ; here , it seemed goofy    and cut the dramatic tension considerably .^\n\nPerhaps future writers , if a show    is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from Marvel Comics \' 2099 series    of comics .^\n\nMake up a bunch of new bad words for the future .^\n\nThis way , you    do n\'t  need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul    language .    ^\n\nCompared to the usual crap broadcast TV networks have to offer in terms of    movies , BLADE SQUAD is a suitable exercise in camp .^\n\nWhen compared to , say , a    movie studio film , BLADE SQUAD has a lot in common with a term which shares    its initials : BS .^\n\n( Review written August 12 , 1998 ) '
cv845_15886.txt,'Starring: Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright, Chazz Palminteri, Garry    Shandling, Anna Paquin, Meg Ryan.    ^\n\nWhat a contrast !^\n\nIn the space of two days , I saw Shakespeare In Love and    HurlyBurly .^\n\nI \'m  not sure you could get two more different movies .^\n\nWhile the    former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy    of life down our throats , HurlyBurly was the complete opposite , wound so    tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking    about it .    ^\n\nThis is one interesting movie .^\n\nIt \'s  very much in a similar vein to one of my    favourite movies of \'98 , In the Company of Men , although not quite so nasty .   ^\n\nThere \'s  lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men .    ^\n\nHurlyBurly doens\'t contain much plot : we just follow Eddie ( Sean Penn )    around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him .^\n\nHis    big question is : does it all pertain to him ?^\n\nAnd if it does , how is he    supposed to feel about it all ?^\n\n\" It \" means everything : television , friends ,    events that happen .^\n\nI guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what \'s  it    all about ?    ^\n\nThis is not a movie for answers .^\n\nDonna ( Anna Paquin ) gives some but they \'re     not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions .^\n\nThat \'s  what makes    this movie stay on your mind .^\n\nThese are the sorts of questions that occupy    our time .^\n\nEven when we push them to the background , however we resolve these    questions influences everything we do .    ^\n\nThe performances are all superb in HurlyBurly .^\n\nI have n\'t  seen Sean Penn in    much before ( in fact , I ca n\'t  remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is    brilliant in this .^\n\nEddie is n\'t  a likeable character , but Sean Penn makes him    understandable .^\n\nI do n\'t  want to be his friend but I \'d  like to help him .   ^\n\nChazz Palminteri is also great as Phil , making him an awful person .^\n\nI \'d     never want to know Phil but still I understand why Eddie wants to be his    friend .^\n\nEveryone in this film nails their performances , making this world    real .    ^\n\nIt \'s  a nasty world ; it \'s  a sexist world .^\n\nUnlike Shakespeare In Love which is    unfailingly  politically  correct ,  HurlyBurly  is a man \'s  world , seen    unapologetically through the eyes of men .^\n\nI find this fascinating and on two    counts , depressing .^\n\nFirst , it \'s  depressing that such a world exists .^\n\nA large    part of HurlyBurly \'s  success is that it convinces me that such people are    real and that this sort of environment exists every day in Hollywood ; that    there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely    peripheral to their world , toys , playthings .^\n\nSure , everyone is background to    everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background .   ^\n\nSecond , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men \'s  world .   ^\n\nWhere are the stories about women \'s  world ?^\n\nNot the soap operas and the    \" chick flicks \" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that    touch on the essence of life like HurlyBurly does for men .    ^\n\nHurlyBurly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the    film starts .^\n\nIt \'s  very talkative , intelligent and static .^\n\nWhile this can    make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they \'re  quoting    textbooks , mostly this is a good thing .^\n\nNot all films have to be filled with    special effects and sweeping panoramas .^\n\nNot all films have to underestimate    the intelligence of their audience .^\n\nAll it means is that HurlyBurly is    probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen .^\n\nIt also    means that you have to pay attention .

Kelley and Sean O\'Byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy .  ^\n\nThey try to make you laugh and cry  , to feel outrage and pride .  ^\n\nThey present the framing and cadence for jokes  , but there \'s   nothing truly funny .  ^\n\nThey show appropriately staged scenes of sadness  , but they give you nothing to be really sad about .  ^\n\nAs columnist Molly Ivins would say  , it \'s   all hat  , no cattle .  ^\n\nThe perfect opportunity arises for Roach to say what this movie is really about .  ^\n\nThere is a funeral scene  , played with appropriate gravity and somber music .  ^\n\nIt is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what \'s   truly important .  ^\n\nRussell Crowe steps forward to speak  , about to spell out the movie \'s   metaphor for us .  ^\n\nHe says that what really matters in life is  \" community   ... .  \"  ^\n\nThen adds  \" and hockey .  \"  ^\n\nI guess these Mysterians really are as shallow as they appear .  ^\n\nOnly mildly bad  , Mystery  , Alaska probably deserves 2 stars .  ^\n\nI even laughed out loud  , genuine laughs in places .  ^\n\nBut I docked it an extra half star when Mike Myers  , a friend of Roach  , turned up in a role that did n\'t   suit him .  ^\n\nMyers is a comic character actor .  ^\n\nHe puts on masks  , becomes an outrageous caricature  , and is funny .  ^\n\nHe \'s   great as Austin Powers  , Dr. Evil  , or any of his Scottish characters .   ^\n\nNobody else in MYSTERTY  , ALASKA is a comic caricature .  ^\n\nAll the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles .  ^\n\nFor Roach to bring in Myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast  , toward his audience  , and indeed toward the film itself .  ^\n\nIt \'s   an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously .  ^\n\nI recommend you take his word for it .

cv849_17215.txt,'Ironically, one of the themes of 200 Cigarettes is that you should try to    make the best of every moment in life.^\n\nUnfortunately I will no longer be    able to say that I lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because I    spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a    movie .^\n\nActually smoking 200 cigarettes in the sameminutes could n\'t  be any    worse for you than it is to watch the movie .^\n\nNot only is it a pathetically    bad film overall , but 200 Cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities    whatsoever .^\n\nThe plot is scattered , thin and predictable ; the acting is    monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video .    ^\n\nIt is December 31 , 1981 and the big party is at Monica \'s  ( Martha Plimpton )    house .^\n\nBut no one has arrived yet .^\n\nHerinvited guests and several people that    they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of New    York City in various groups .^\n\nSome of them know each other through their    common bond of having slept with Monica , and some are total strangers .^\n\nBut    they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night \'s  end .    ^\n\nThose who are invited are the ones that have the issues .^\n\nIt is up to those    who are n\'t  to help them come to terms .^\n\nFirst there is Eric ( Brian McCardie )    who  is  a  former  boyfriend of Monica \'s  and is just getting over the    heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his    sexual performance , or lack thereof .^\n\nHe is one of the most bland characters ,    in  a  film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and    stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production .    ^\n\nBridget ( Nicole Parker ) and Caitlyn ( Angela Featherstone ) who are both    extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires    on New Year \'s  Eve and tag along to the party with them .^\n\nThey stumble across    a nameless bartender ( Ben Affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in    a film of imperfections .^\n\nHe is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about    his  future , as he is in law school .^\n\nHis lack of flaws is both boring ,    unrealistic and painful to watch .^\n\nAs Bridget and Caitlyn make passes at him    you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy .    ^\n\nMoving on , there is Val ( Christina Ricci ) and Stephie , ( Gabby Hoffman ) 2    teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts .^\n\nVal is    Monica \'s  cousin and a true fan of the New York scene .^\n\nOn the other hand ,    Stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture    out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just ca n\'t     find .^\n\nParadoxically , it ispunks that they meet at a bar ( actually they    attempt to flee from their presence , but are n\'t  successful ) who guide them    through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds .    ^\n\nOf all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a    level of decency in both acting and plot .^\n\nWisely , the movie \'s  creators have    put heavy emphasis on Lucy ( Courtney Love ) and Kevin ( Paul Rudd ) who are    best friends and share the common bond of being dateless .^\n\nPaul has just    broken up with long time steady Ellie ( Janeane Garofalo ) and is starting to    come  to terms with his loss when Lucy informs him that Ellie had been    sleeping around during their relationship .^\n\nHowever , the only complexity to    these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and    that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall    on more than one occasion during this strange evening .    ^\n\nFinally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the    film .^\n\nJack ( Jay Mohr ) and Cindy ( Kate Hudson ) have been going out for a    short period of time and Jack just learned that he took Cindy \'s  virginity    the night before .^\n\nWhile she attempts to play this down and be her usual    self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a    string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered Cindy .    ^\n\nVery often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least    be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory .   ^\n\nHowever , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments    of glory to be highlighted .^\n\nInstead , what you get is a collection of rough    and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies .^\n\nFirst , and most    noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no    apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily    edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot .^\n\nAt other times , objects    seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to    shot .^\n\nThere are also at leastscenes in a taxi cab that go from start to    finish .^\n\nNot in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver .    ^\n\nAnd yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor    the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad    plots .^\n\nPerhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two    or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for    some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff    at the end .^\n\nBut it did n\'t  happen that way .^\n\nThe cast of quality name actors    was  forced  into roles that not even one of them could convert into a    mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than    it takes for the ball to drop at midnight .

cv850_18185.txt,'1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in Hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject  , or  , to be precise  , same  \" high concept  \" .  ^\n\nIn Summer 1994  , that  \" high concept  \" was  \" mad bomber action thriller  \" .  ^\n\nIn few weeks  ,  \" thrillride of the summer  \" actionfest SPEED was followed by rather action thriller BLOWN AWAY  , so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which Nicole Eggert did few nude scenes .  ^\n\nThe movie begins in the prison in Northern Ireland  , where Gaerity ( Tommy Lee Jones  )  , IRA terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material  , escapes from prison .  ^\n\nHe comes to Boston  , where he accidentally notices Jimmy Dove ( Jeff Bridges  )  , dedicated bomb disposal expert within Boston police .  ^\n\nFew people except Gaerity know the Dove \'s   violent past  , when he used to be IRA terrorist before becoming sick with violence  , betraying Gaerity and emigrating to America where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose .  ^\n\nGaerity holds Dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror  , directed specifically at Dove \'s   colleagues  , friends and relatives .  ^\n\nDove  , who is just going to retire and start family  , now must confront the mad bomber .  ^\n\nWhile SPEED does n\'t   even try to bother with plot and characters  , using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes  , BLOWN AWAY tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story .  ^\n\nAnd that is the main reason why it is inferior to SPEED .  ^\n\nBadly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all .  ^\n\nScreenplay by John Bateer and John Rice  , barely touches the complicated issues of Northern Ireland  , using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama .  ^\n\nThe plot is  , of course  , full of implausibilities .  ^\n\nThe main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual  , no matter how brilliant he is  , can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay .  ^\n\nThose questions  , same as in the case of SPEED  , could be forgotten while the action goes on  , but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters .  ^\n\nBecause of them  , movie seems a little bit too long  , and boring at times .  ^\n\nThe most annoying element of the film  , however  , is Tommy Lee Jones in the role of mad bomber .  ^\n\nHis acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself .  ^\n\nThis role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in FUGITIVE .  ^\n\nThe film have few bright points  , though .  ^\n\nSome of the action scenes are fine  , which should be credited to director Stephen Hopkins ( PREDATOR II  , JUDGEMENT NIGHT  ) .  ^\n\nAnd Forrest Whitaker really shines in minor role of Dove \'s   colleague .  ^\n\nBut  , all in all  , BLOWN AWAY is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous  , yet hardly unforgettable competitor .

cv862_15924.txt,'The original Babe gets my vote as the best family film since The Princess    Bride, and it\'s sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet    critics, both Siskel and Ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of    the year\'s finest films.^\n\nSo , naturally , when I entered the screening room    that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be    found , this notion left me puzzled .^\n\nIt is a rare thing for a children \'s     movie to be praised this highly , so would n\'t  you think that every parent in    the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly    \" magical \" piece of work ?^\n\nA tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry    about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with    family films , I sat back forminutes and watched intently and with a very    open mind , having great expectations for the film .^\n\nLooking back , I should    have taken the hint and left right when I entered the theater .    ^\n\nBelieve  me ;  I  wanted to like Babe : Pig in the City .^\n\nThe plot seemed    interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , Babe    the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon .^\n\nBut after a    fateful encounter with a water well , Arthur Hogget ( James Cromwell , who the    movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a    number  of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially .^\n\nThe only    solution that his wife ( Magda Szubanski , going from delightfully charming to    downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new    celebrity pet at a national fair ( I think ) and to use the money they earn to    pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more    than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the    public ) .^\n\nProblem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded    \" city \" , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion .    ^\n\nSetting the main plot in motion , Mrs. Hogget and Babe travel to the unnamed    city  and  shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help    animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels .^\n\nIt is here    that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the    family of chimps led by Steven Wright .    ^\n\nHere is where the film took a wrong turn .^\n\nUp until this point , I had being    having a rather enjoyable experience .^\n\nThe beginning featured some smart    writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one    and even an inspired moment at the airport where Mrs. Hogget is accused of    smuggling drugs .^\n\nUnfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to    a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even    one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous Babe .    ^\n\nThe  main topic of discussion surrounding Babe : Pig in the City is the    question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children ,    and I believe it is .^\n\nAt one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly    starts to drown .^\n\nAt other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs    to Mrs. Hogget \'s  full cavity search at the airport .^\n\nIn fact , the overall    tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing .^\n\nHowever , that is , as they    say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie    anyway .^\n\nThe animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing    enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a    child .    ^\n\nAnother problem I found with the film was it \'s  sudden change of pacing and    tone near the end of the story .^\n\nIf you \'re  going to make a darker and more    sinister sequel , fine .^\n\nIt may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a    noble ambition .^\n\nBut to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie    and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with Mrs. Hogget swinging from    wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ?^\n\nIt just did n\'t  feel right    and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the    same goes for the rest of the movie .    ^\n'

cv867_18362.txt,'Whenever U.S. government starts meddling into other countries  \' affairs  , under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political  , religious or ethnic persecution  , the other side is ready to use mantra that says  \" Look who \'s   talking  !  ^\n\nWhat have you done to the Indians  ?  \"  ^\n\nHowever  , even the Americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes .  ^\n\nHollywood is just another example  , with its revisionist westerns  , made in early 1990s .  ^\n\nThose movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of Political Correctness  , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of Columbus  \' discovery of America .  ^\n\nOne of such examples is GERONIMO  : AN AMERICAN LEGEND  , 1993 western directed by Walter Hill  , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between American natives and white settlers .  ^\n\nThe hero of the film is Geronimo ( played by Wes Studi  )  , leader of Apaches  , fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century .  ^\n\nWhen the movie begins  , in 1885  , Geronimo and his Apaches made peace with U.S. government and try to live peacefully in Arizona reservation .  ^\n\nHowever  , broken promises  , injustice and violence against his people would make Geronimo restless .  ^\n\nWith not more 30 or so of his followers  , he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign .  ^\n\nGeneral Crook ( Gene Hackman  )  , commander of U.S. Army forces  , respects Geronimo and knows that even his 5,000 force is n\'t   enough to catch Geronimo in the great spaces of the American Southwest .  ^\n\nInstead  , he turns to people who are more experienced with Apaches - Lt .^\n\nCharles Gatewood ( Jason Patric  ) and Indian hunter Al Sieber ( Robert Duvall  ) .  ^\n\nTogether with young Lt .^\n\nBritton Davis ( Matt Damon  ) they would begin mission aimed at capturing Geronimo .  ^\n\nGERONIMO  : AN AMERICAN LEGEND  , like many movies made under the shadow of Political Correctness  , try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities  , but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors .  ^\n\nSo  , the story about Geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies .  ^\n\nAlmost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people .  ^\n\nAlthough such elements of John Millius  \' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history  , they harm the story of Geronimo .  ^\n\nTo be honest  , Walter Hill does try to make Geronimo the real hero of the film  , but the movie segments that deal with the plight of Apaches and the uprising are given too little time .  ^\n\nInstead  , they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of Gatewood and his band .  ^\n\nTo make even worse  , Hill has some real problems with pacing and style  , and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one - story about Geronimo and story about his pursuers .  ^\n\nThe movie should have been better if it turned to Geronimo \'s   life before and after his last uprising  , in many ways more interesting than the story about Gatewood .  ^\n\nThe difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting .  ^\n\nWes Studi  , Cherokee actor who was so impressive as Magua in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS  , was perfect choice for Geronimo  , not only because he resembles Geronimo  , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role .  ^\n\nContrary to him  , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies .  ^\n\nWhile this could be expected from someone like Jason Patric  , it is shame when we have veterans like Gene Hackman or Robert Duvall .  ^\n\nEven Hill \'s   directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and  , like in many of his late films  , force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s .  ^\n\nEven his old associate  , music composer Ry Cooder  , disappoints  , with the score that shifts between Indian motives and classic .  ^\n\nOn the other hand  , photography by Lloyd Ahern II  , with the use of red lenses  , gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere  , ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic .  ^\n\nAll in all  , compared with some of the Hollywood \'s   examples of Political Correctness  , this film is n\'t   so bad  , but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better .

cv871_25971.txt,'Paul  Verhoeven,  the  Dutch  auteur who dragged his violent, sexually    aggressive aesthetic into American film, has never been what I\'d consider a    thoughtful director (though some of his films, notably STARSHIP TROOPERS,    have been lauded as artistic achievements), but he is the kind of Hollywood    film maker who\'s managed to, no matter what the budget, make his films    distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish    high  concepts  on which he toils.^\n\nSTARSHIP TROOPERS was essentially a    B-monster movie remake of his enthralling Dutch War film SOLDIER OF ORANGE    ( a great film that \'s  nearly impossible to find on video , yet SHOWGIRLS is    everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ;    the square jawed Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards ( who may actually be    45 \% silicone ) , in what feels like an American propaganda picture set to    monotonous scenes of graphic carnage .^\n\nIt \'s  not a completely successful film ,    but as a failure it \'s  certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining )    one .    ^\n\nMy favorite Verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ;    SPETTERS ,  a  dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the    sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned SOLDIER OF ORANGE ( have n\'t     yet gotten around to seeing THE 4th MAN or TURKISH DELIGHT ) .^\n\nI believe his    best Hollywood film to be ROBOCOP , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic    hero that \'s  as touching as Schwarzenegger \'s  in T2 .^\n\nThat movie was violent    but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent Verhoeven pics .^\n\nIts    violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of    unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience .   ^\n\nThere \'s  a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of ROBOCOP wherein    the  lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him .^\n\nHe tortures the    officer by taking glee in his victim \'s  every fearful tic .^\n\nIt \'s  a startling    moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for    the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir .    ^\n\nIn HOLLOW MAN Kevin Bacon brutally slays a dog because it just wo n\'t  shut    up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on .^\n\nBut why ?^\n\nHis character    is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who \'s  always impeccably dressed and    races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the    world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from DALLAS or MELROSE    PLACE , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a    180 shift into a psychotic movie monster .^\n\nThe kind who just wo n\'t  die .   ^\n\nHOLLOW MAN \'s  protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist    Linda ( Elizabeth Shue , acting as if she were Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm ) and    her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by Josh Brolin who \'s  saddled with    the film \'s  worst lines ( \" I \'ve  lost cohesion again ! \" ) .^\n\nThey \'re  a typical    Aaron  Spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as George W.

cv872_13710.txt,'Fact that Charles Bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade .  ^\n\nTragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies  , but the quantity .  ^\n\nMost of those movies were produced by Cannon Group  , company led by Israeli producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus .  ^\n\nThose two men probably thought that they could be the next Roger Corman  , B- movie mentors of future Hollywood legends .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , that did n\'t   happened  , and when Cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade  , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage  , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal .  ^\n\nSadly for Bronson  , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead  , and lowering his own reputation in process .  ^\n\nOn the other hand  , Bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular  , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than Bronson himself .  ^\n\nOne of such movies that seriously marred Bronson \'s   reputation is DEATH WISH 3  , third sequel in the series which began with DEATH WISH in 1974 .  ^\n\nIn the original movie  , Bronson played Paul Kersey  , mild-mannered New York architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence .  ^\n\nThat movie was far from masterpiece  ; yet  , in it the director Michael Winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like Siegel in DIRTY HARRY  ) .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , six years later Cannon Group got rights to the character of Paul Kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels  ; even the presence of its original director did n\'t   stop the rapid decline of the quality .  ^\n\nDEATH WISH 3 begins when Kersey comes to visit an old friend  , living in the urban wasteland of East New York  , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out .   ^\n\nBefore the reunion  , Kersey \'s   friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil Fraker ( played by Gavan O\'Herlihy  , probably the only noteworthy role in the film  ) .  ^\n\nKersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade  , while the police inspector Shriker ( Ed Lauter  )  , ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime .  ^\n\nBronson  , the main asset in this movie  , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine .  ^\n\nAlthough Bronson \'s   charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower  )  , the lack of emotions or Bronson \'s   own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film .  ^\n\nThe movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness  , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by Deborah Raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for Kersey \'s   crusade .  ^\n\nOn the other hand  , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding  , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks  , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by Kersey .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , Michael Winner does n\'t   know how to work out the plot  , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations  , ends this movie with a bang .  ^\n\nThe big showdown at the end - that turns East New York into the Sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie  , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget .  ^\n\nIn short  , this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical Charles Bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia .  ^\n\n( Special note for trekkies  : Marina Sirtis  , the actress who played Counsellor Deanna Troi in STAR TREK  : THE NEXT GENERATION could be spotted in a small role of Portorican wife  ) .

Anderson Black is about as formulaic and generic as they come .  ^\n\nComic books have better plots than this .  ^\n\nThe movie is so bad  , in fact  , that it retains that ridiculous Tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer \'s   comedy  \" George of the Jungle .  \"  ^\n\nDid n\'t   the producers think to leave that back in the old Weissmuller pictures where it belongs  ?  ^\n\nThe story starts with the legend of Tarzan already firmly established  : a quick opening narration tells of Tarzan ( Casper Van Dien  ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes  , and his return to England where he assumes his Greystoke heritage .  ^\n\nWhen the movie starts in 1913  , he is a civilized English gentleman ( without an English accent  )  , and he is to marry Jane ( Jane March  ) in less than a week .  ^\n\nHowever  , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named Nigel Ravens ( Steve Waddington  ) begins hunting for the fabled lost City of Opar  , one of Africa \'s   last great secrets  , the witch doctor of an ancient African tribe summons Tarzan back to the jungle .  ^\n\nAt first  , Jane refuses to go  , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding  ; but after Tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down  , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man .  ^\n\nOnce the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way  )  , it delves into a series of jungle adventures  , as Tarzan  , Jane  , and the natives attempt the thwart Ravens and his crew from discovering the city .  ^\n\nMost of the so-called adventures are cheesy  , predictable  , and unexciting  , with no pace  , tension  , or action to speak of .  ^\n\nThere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies  , ranging from  \" Raiders of the Lost Ark  \" ( 1981  ) to  \" The Goonies  \" ( 1985  ) .  ^\n\nWhen the movie is running short on action  , it includes a few Greenpeace-friendly scenes of Tarzan freeing caged animals  , releasing a baby elephant from a trap  , and throwing ivory tusks into the river .  ^\n\nThe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality .  ^\n\nFor instance  , when Tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra  , he does n\'t   even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do .  ^\n\nInstead  , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival .  ^\n\nOf course  , one ca n\'t   help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is .  ^\n\nNot to ruin the ending or anything  , but there is no lost city .  ^\n\nThere is  , however  , a lost pyramid  , which I suppose is all the resource-strapped FX department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-TV movie  ) .  ^\n\nWhich also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid  , when it \'s   sitting right out in the middle of an open field  ?  ^\n\nStrictly speaking  ,  \" Tarzan and the Lost City  \" is n\'t   even bad enough to have camp quality  , although Casper Van Dien \'s   laughably stiff performance comes real close .  ^\n\nThis movie proves what  \" Starship Troopers  \" only hinted at  : he cannot act  , but he sure looks well-groomed  , even in the deepest heart of the African jungle .  ^\n\nVan Dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective Tarzan  ; he \'s   a Calvin Klein model in a loin cloth .  ^\n\nI also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 Steve Perry haircut .  ^\n\nWaddington makes a decent villain  , although he \'s   like a charmless version of Belloq from  \" Raiders of the Lost Ark .  \"  ^\n\nAs Jane  , the ex-model Jane March has little to do but smile and look pretty next to Tarzan .  ^\n\nShe does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two  , but whenever a snake comes into the picture  , she is reduced to a hysterical mess .  ^\n\nHowever  , amidst all this complaining  , I do have one piece of good news .  ^\n\n\" Tarzan and the Lost City  \" is so lacking in ideas both new and old  , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid .  ^\n\nSo  , we can say this much for it  : at least it had the decency to be short  .'

cv876_9633.txt,'While the extremely peculiar A Life Less    Ordinary does live up to its title, a more appropriate moniker would be A    Movie More Misguided, for this confused, confusing attempt at romantic    comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented Trainspotting team of    director Danny Boyle, producer Andrew Macdonald, and screenwriter John    Hodge. ^\n\nAt  the core of this strange film is a fairly basic -- and , yes ,    ordinary -- premise .^\n\nAfter Robert ( Boyle regular Ewan McGregor ) , an aspiring    writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the Naville    Corporation ,  he  kidnaps Naville \'s  ( Ian Holm ) spoiled daughter Celine    ( Cameron Diaz ) and holds her for ransom .^\n\nThe joke here is that Celine is a    willing victim -- her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she    wants revenge -- and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the    brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept Robert a thing or two about    kidnapping  ... and , ultimately ( did n\'t  we see this one coming ? ) , love .^\n\nSo    far , so mediocre .^\n\nBut mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is ,    thanks in no small part to the Hodge \'s  contextual frame for the romance .^\n\nIt    turns out that God is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate    on earth , so the chief of Heaven \'s  police , Gabriel ( Dan Hedaya ) dispatches    two angels , O\'Reilly ( Holly Hunter ) and Jackson ( Delroy Lindo ) , to earth to    hook up Celine and Robert -- or lose their angel status .^\n\nThis conceit might    have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire    picture .^\n\nBut it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the    film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the    romance at hand .^\n\nNot that there is much of a romance to begin with .^\n\nTry as    Diaz and McGregor may , Celine and Robert are too one-note to become very    endearing characters .^\n\nCeline is rich bitch ; Robert is a dullard .^\n\nAs such , it    is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two -- then again ,    they never seem to really connect with each other .^\n\nWhen Celine and Robert    start to overtly act on their \" feelings , \" it comes off more like something    scripted than anything natural .^\n\nBut I am not exactly sure if Boyle and    company \'s  point was romance ; honestly , I am not exactly sure what they were    trying to accomplish .^\n\nBoyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic    razzmatazz , but it remains just that -- energy , not energy in service of a    story  or  even  acting .^\n\nThe cast seems lost , especially Hunter , whose    performance is so adrift as to be baffling .^\n\nAnd then there are the many    eccentricities  splattered  onto the film : some violent confrontations    involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic -- in fact , they end up    staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a    cutesy Claymation epilogue .^\n\nWatching much of A Life Less Ordinary is like    being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool .   ^\n\nInstead , the film just gives quirky a bad name .^\n\nMy best guess as to what the    filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes ,    misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an    extended musical number where Celine and Robert sing \" Beyond the Sea \" at a    karaoke bar .^\n\nAfter a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in    snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the    counter .^\n\nThe scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but    also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of    the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport .^\n\nAlas , not nearly    enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end .^\n\nI applaud any    attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes    even cleverness can reach overkill .^\n\nA Life Less Ordinary certainly delivers    something \" different , \" but by the time the film was over , I was clamoring    for A Life More Ordinary .    ^\n\n'

cv882_10042.txt,'There are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons .  ^\n\nThey provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context  , from the outrageous slapstick of Looney Tunes to the intensity of Japanimation .  ^\n\nWatching  \" Flubber  \" really clinched this idea for me  , because it \'s   just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy .  ^\n\nIt proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality  , and how important it is to actually have a story .  ^\n\nThe film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted  , cartoony atmosphere .  ^\n\nWe meet Medfield College chemistry professor Phillip Brainard ( Williams  )  , the typical  , supposedly likable mad scientist .  ^\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is .  ^\n\nPhillip \'s   memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of Alzhiemer \'s   Disease - is n\'t   this rather lowbrow comedy  ?  ^\n\nHe starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids  \' movie if I ever saw one  ) .  ^\n\nWe learn he has stood his up fiancee  , Sara ( Harden  )  , twice at the altar simply because he \'s   forgotten .  ^\n\nSara claims to love him  , but says if he forgets the wedding again she \'ll   stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has  ) .   ^\n\nBut even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve  , and it \'s   no surprise the major conflicts here are related .  ^\n\nChristopher McDonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as Wilson Croft  , a scientist who not only wants to steal Phillip \'s   ideas  , but his woman too .  ^\n\nWhat \'s   worse is that Sara actually seems interested in him  !  ^\n\nWilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out Medfield  , which is going broke  , unless Phillip can invent something to save the day .  ^\n\nOne of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film .  ^\n\nThe flubber is played for gags after it is introduced  , but is all but forgotten about thereafter .  ^\n\nIt \'s   obvious Phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber  , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy  , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , the flubber  , like all the special effects in this film  , looks very fake and unconvincing .   ^\n\nFlubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality  , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine  , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object .  ^\n\nMost of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since Phillip \'s   absent-mindedness is forgotten about  ) and somehow push the story along .  ^\n\nBut it \'s   clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse .  ^\n\nAll the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving  , flubber-powered objects including  : bowling balls  ; flying cars that do n\'t   fly well  ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air .  ^\n\nIt \'s   all presented with complete logic  , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes .  ^\n\nDuring the basketball scene  , the coach for the rival team actually says  ,  \" I think they might be cheating  ,  \" to which the referee replies  ,  \" There \'s   no rules about jumping too high .  \"  ^\n\n\" Predictable  \" does n\'t   begin to describe the motions the film goes through  , especially after the halfway point .  ^\n\nAnd it \'s   not how terribly contrived the plot is  , it \'s   the way it \'s   broken down scene-by-scene  , with absolutely no transition .  ^\n\nNot only that  , but all the actors here  , especially Williams  , seem bored to tears .  ^\n\nI \'d   say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen  , so it \'s   almost forgivable when you realize they \'re   talking to nothing and interacting with nothing .  ^\n\nIt \'s   safe to say everything that could be bad about  \" Flubber  \" is .  ^\n\nThe only original element the film has is the world \'s   first romance between a machine and a human .  ^\n\nBut this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it  , and  , like the rest of the film  , you wo n\'t    .'

cv884_15230.txt,'For those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what \'s   left of it in mainstream Hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things .  ^\n\nAs a rule  , the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor .  ^\n\nAn actor might be chosen on the up-and-up  , to give him exposure  ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck .  ^\n\nGenerally  , though  , the actor does n\'t   matter  , and SOLDIER  , the latest from the beleaguered Warner Brothers  , exemplifies this  : the picture lacks pizazz .   ^\n\nThe star for the vehicle in this case is Kurt Russell  , otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less .  ^\n\nRussell plays Todd  , a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought .  ^\n\nThe movie lets us see this degenerate process  , but by the time the real plot starts  , we \'re   into Todd \'s   later years .  ^\n\nHe \'s   about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers  , ones who  , instead of being trained *from* birth  , are genetically selected *before* birth .  ^\n\nThe pride of this class - Caine 607 ( Jason Scott Lee  ) - will be our villain  , and you know he \'s   the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie \'s   start .   ^\n\nBetween the two leads  , less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken  , and it \'s   possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction .  ^\n\nDirector Paul Anderson  , who helmed last year \'s   icy thriller  , EVENT HORIZON  , does n\'t   show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam .  ^\n\nTodd  , upon being replaced  , is left to die on a garbage planet  ; but in order to stretch the running time out  , the villains return to the garbage planet on a  \" routine patrol  \" and set the stage for the final firefight .  ^\n\nEvents are predictable from the time that the setups are made  , and neither Anderson nor scriptwriter David Peoples attempts to show any creativeness here .   ^\n\nThe most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be  : Todd fails to show physical superiority against Caine - in fact  , not even Todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry .  ^\n\nIt \'s   not as though Todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story  , and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it .  ^\n\nThe best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit  , and treat it as a parody of typical action fare  , like UNIVERSAL SOLDIER .  ^\n\nA strict interpretation  , however  , reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style  , class  , or substance  ; and by next year  , a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television  .'

) and in the course of their relentlessy    tedious  sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the Hurricane \'s     innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two    proceedings .^\n\nOf course , we \'re  already told that he \'s  innocent .    ^\n\nA movie like this is especially frustrating because we \'re  not being shown    everything significant that happened to Carter during this period in his    life .^\n\nAll too obviously , we \'re  getting the Hollywood watered- down version .   ^\n\nThat would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every    single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of    it .^\n\nIt \'s  almost cruel .^\n\nThe melodrama is n\'t  of the entertaining kind either ;    it \'s  the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is    exaggerated to the point of absurdity .^\n\nWitness the villain ferociously    grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of    our four protagonists .    ^\n\nThe  Hurricane  is  your basic courtroom movie except it \'s  a no-frills    courtroom movie .^\n\nIt \'s  formula stripped to the bare necessities .^\n\nYou have    your wrongly accused black man .^\n\nYou have your melodramatic final courtroom    scene . ^\n\nBut  there \'s  nothing else .^\n\nYou \'d  expect some sort of involving    investigation .^\n\nBut that \'s  not necessary since we \'re  implicitly informed of    his innocence .^\n\nThus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the    protagonist  brooding .^\n\nBrooding to himself .^\n\nBrooding to other inmates .   ^\n\nBrooding  to  Lesra .^\n\nBrooding to Lesra \'s  Canadian friends .^\n\nBrooding in    letters .^\n\nI do n\'t  think I \'ll  ever look at brooding the same way again .^\n\nIt    was n\'t  long before I got tired of hearing the Hurricane \'s  exceedingly deep    meditations on his condition .^\n\nI wanted something to happen .    ^\n\nAs for Washington \'s  performance in the title role --  I figured I \'d  have to    address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it \'s  received    --  he is top notch , though still boring .^\n\nHow is that possible ?^\n\nWell , he does    what Jewison wanted him to do perfectly .^\n\nUnfortunately what Jewison asked    him to do is a load of crap .^\n\nWhat a waste of a great performer .    ^\n\nSpeaking of wastes , why the hell did John Hannah agree to do this ?^\n\nHe \'s  an    extremely talented actor and I love him dearly , but what is he doing here ?   ^\n\nTo call his character ( along with Schreiber \'s  and Unger \'s  ) a stick figure    would be a gross understatement .^\n\nAll three of them come off as veritable    Mother Theresas , as benevolent as do-gooders come .^\n\nIf they \'re  to play a    major part in this movie , why not make them real people , with real feelings    and emotions ?    ^\n\nLook : if you \'re  going to make a formula movie , do n\'t  undermine the formula .   ^\n\nCourtroom dramas can be fun , but this is ridiculous .^\n\nNot only is it trite ,    it \'s  boring .

cv891_6035.txt,'Depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , LAST MAN STANDING is either a )    a Prohibition-era remake of Akira Kurosawa \'s  1961 classic YOJIMBO ; b ) a    Prohibition-era remake of Sergio Leone \'s  1964 classic A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS ;    c ) a Prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line .^\n\nNew    Line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential    viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent    remakes  of  DIABOLIQUE  and  THE  VANISHING  counted on avoiding such    comparisons .^\n\nThe fact is that there is yet another way of looking at LAST    MAN STANDING , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to    the _real_ source material , the Dashiell Hammett novel _Red Harvest_ .^\n\nIt    also shows that Kurosawa and Leone knew better what to do with that material    than Hammett himself .    ^\n\nThis time around , The Man With No Name is played by Bruce Willis , a fellow    with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the Texas border    town of Jericho one day on his way to Mexico .^\n\nBy all appearances , Jericho is    well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants    generally  belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for    control of liquor coming over the border .^\n\nOne is headed by an Irishman named    Doyle ( David Patrick Kelly ) ; the other is run by Chicago-connected Italian    mobster Strozzi ( Ned Eisenberg ) .^\n\nCalling himself John Smith , the man decides    that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as    an enforcer to Doyle \'s  side .^\n\nBut Smith \'s  allegiance is as uncertain as his    name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to    stay one step ahead of both of them .    ^\n\nViewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find    virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that    alone should make LAST MAN STANDING somewhat more respectable than other    recent  Hollywood  remakes-cum-bastardizations . ^\n\nThere  is the happily    ineffectual lawman ( Bruce Dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the    bosses \' affections ( Karina Lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero \'s     only friend ( William Sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( Christopher Walken    and Michael Imperioli ) to question the bosses \' trust in Smith , a brutal    beating , and a big fire .^\n\nDirector Walter Hill gives the proceedings his    usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for Willis which have    the  ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to    achieve escape velocity , but at least he does n\'t  try to turn the story into    a slasher film or a buddy picture .    ^\n\nWhat he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a    running  voice-over  narration  by  Willis which rings of the standard    hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction .^\n\nYes , that narration is full of    cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling .^\n\nThe problem is that    both  YOJIMBO  and  A  FISTFUL  OF  DOLLARS  succeeded  largely on the    inscrutability of their lead characters .^\n\nThey were a mystery , to the other    characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely    clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their    almost  mythical  status .^\n\nWith John Smith \'s  voice chattering on in the    background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane ,    just another tough guy trying to stay alive .^\n\nIt feels like a Hammett novel ,    all right , and Hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but    it simply does n\'t  work .^\n\nThe narration allows The Man With No Name to take us    into  his confidence , and The Man With No Name takes _no one_ into his    confidence .    ^\n\nEven if you walk into LAST MAN STANDING as a blank slate , I ca n\'t  imagine it    being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction .^\n\nWillis tones down    his macho swagger as the taciturn Smith , but there is still a level on which    he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else    rather than smarter than everyone else .^\n\nChristopher Walken plays Doyle \'s     brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos ,    and there is n\'t  another single character whom makes even the slightest    impression .^\n\nWith no compelling antagonist for Smith , there is no build-up    towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over    so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about .^\n\nCinematographer Lloyd    Ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on Hill \'s  1995 flop WILD BILL )    creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye    distracted  between  the  spurts  of  gunfire  and  the  next  bit  of    counter-productive narration .^\n\nSometimes when someone sees a lackluster    remake of a revered original , they \'ll  wonder what all the talk was about .^\n\nIn    the case of LAST MAN STANDING , it is those who know the originals who will    wonder what all that talking was about .

cv892_18788.txt,'Okay, bear with me y\'all, cause first off I have to get this off my chest:     WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH THAT DAMN CRAB???    ^\n\nWhew .^\n\nOkay .^\n\nCause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to    get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe .^\n\nEven I know    that you need more footage than that .^\n\nAnd that was n\'t  the only thing getting    on my nerves .^\n\nThe cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score  / soundtrack and    the pretty young faces of Sarah Michelle Gellar ( as Amanda ) and Sean Patrick    Flannery  ( as  Tom )  might  have  held some appeal during , oh , say the    firstminutes  of the movie .^\n\nAt first the movie moves along at a quick ,    interesting pace .^\n\nIt is speedily established that something magical is about    to happen to Amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather    type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere    and just does n\'t  die .^\n\nA ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point I \'m     willing to accept it because I \'m  willing to accept that this is how Amanda \'s     life is changed , how her powers are received .    ^\n\nLater on , the movie ca n\'t  seem to decide whether these powers come from this    fairy godfather or from Amanda falling in with Tom .^\n\nAnd this is why the    clips of the crab were annoying ; they were n\'t  just repetitive , they were out    of  place and unnecessary .^\n\nThe plot stumbles along at an uneven speed ,    sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( Amanda suddenly    becoming a great chef , her falling in love with Tom , etc. ) , sometimes moving    on too quickly for its own good .^\n\nSome places the plot just does n\'t  make    sense , sometimes it \'s  way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and    sometimes too corny ( Peaches emitting dry ice .^\n\nCa n\'t  beat that ) .^\n\nAll in all    the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected .^\n\nNot romantic at all , and only funny    in some places .^\n\nSo , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ?^\n\nOr the    fairy godfather ?^\n\nShe can float now too ?^\n\nAnd all of a sudden , instead of just    making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ?   ^\n\nTom all of a sudden just accepts Amanda \'s  \" witchcraft \" in the end ?^\n\nWould    people  really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in    Tupac \'s  video ?^\n\nWHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH THAT DAMN CRAB ?^\n\nIt is unfortunate ,    because  I  liked  the basic premise of the movie , until it became too    fantastical and tiresome .^\n\nThe film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or    at least a theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us    long flashback clips andminutes of people crying at their tables .^\n\nThe humor    was  good in some places ( Nolan gets the funniest bits , including that    incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) .^\n\nGellar and Flannery    are qualified actors , and Gellar has a particular charm , but I much prefer    her  playing  the  saucy Buffy ( or even Annette in the upcoming \" Cruel    Intentions \" ) than this sorry excuse for a character .^\n\nIt \'s  almost funny    sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better    than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible .^\n\nThe    supporting character Nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of    Kevin in \" You \'ve  Got Mail \" ( see footnotes ) .^\n\nAnd , as always , typical of a    chick  flick   /  romantic comedy , there \'s  a seemingly endless romantic    soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places .^\n\nThis sort of    got on the nerves after a while , too .    ^\n\n\" Simply  Irresistible \" is not hard to understand , light , funny in some    places , and generally disappointing because it ca n\'t  draw the line between    romance and protracted SAP , between humor and tired slapstick .^\n\nAnd how could    I refrain from making a pun ? . .  .^\n\n\" Simply Irresistible \" is all too easy to    resist .    ^\n\nDid anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to \" You \'ve  Got Mail \" ( or    \" The  Shop  Around  the Corner \" ) ?^\n\nBusiness rivals fall in love .^\n\nFemale    counterpart \'s  business is in danger of being shut down .^\n\nFemale as mother-    like figure guiding her .^\n\nThe annoying , hysterical ex-girlfriends .    ^\n\nI _really_ like Sarah Michelle Gellar \'s  wardrobe . \n'
cv893_26731.txt,'I went to Blair Witch Project 2: Book of Shadows with the highest of hopes.   ^\n\nThe original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ;    I hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor .^\n\nUnfortunately , my    hopes were soon dashed .    ^\n\nAs  the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of    Burkittsville , Maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist    influx to their town as a result of the original Blair Witch Project movie .   ^\n\nIt \'s  a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria    surrounding the first film .^\n\nDuring this segment , we are introduced to the    protagonist , a young man who sells Blair Witch-related memorabilia from his    website .    ^\n\nThe movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see    occurred one year previously .^\n\nWe see the same young man that was selling    Blair Witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution    the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies .^\n\nWe see him having    some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while    a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him .^\n\nWe see him throwing    himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower    stall as a fire hose is turned on him .^\n\nNo explanation is provided for why he    is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to    again .^\n\nI had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a    hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil    doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie .    ^\n\nThe movie cuts again , this time to the present .^\n\nThe young man , whose name is    Jeffrey ( played by Jeffrey Donovan --  as in the first movie , the character    names are identical to the actors \' names , although this movie admits up    front that it is fictional , so there \'s  no reason for the practice this time    around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the    woods  that weekend for the \" Blair Witch Hunt , \" which is a promotional    gimmick he came up with and sells on his website .    ^\n\nWe meet Tristen and Steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the    Blair Witch experience .^\n\nSteven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be    the result of mass hysteria .^\n\nTristen , on the other hand , believes that there    may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence .^\n\nShe is wan and    soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly .^\n\n( She also    complains that she feels nauseated ; I knew immediately that the character    was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when Kim    psychomagically  susses it out .^\n\nHow did I know ?^\n\nBecause in bad movies ,    nauseated women are always pregnant . )^\n\nThe fourth member of their party is    Erica , a Wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the    Blair Witch was a good witch , not evil .^\n\nThey pick up the fifth and final    team member in a cemetery .^\n\nKim is dressed completely in black , has extreme    Goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities ,    but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of    the entire bunch .^\n\nPresumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just    for dramatic effect ; it \'s  never explained .    ^\n\nThe party of five heads off into the woods as promised .^\n\nThey reach the    crumbling ruins of the foundation of Rustin Parr \'s  house and set up camp ,    complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night \'s     events .^\n\nThere is a brief encounter with a rival Blair Witch tour group who    had  planned  to  camp at that site as well , but after a few words are    exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere .^\n\nThe movie    veers  off  at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the    drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down .^\n\nSexual innuendoes are    tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much    else happens .^\n\nThis would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom    if necessary .    ^\n\nThe next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment    has been completely trashed , and that Steven and Tristen \'s  manuscript paper    is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow .^\n\nThe videotapes are    missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from Kim , they discover the    videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , \" right where the    original Blair Witch tapes were found ! \"^\n\nOoh .^\n\nSpooky .    ^\n\nThe  team  goes  back to Jeffrey \'s  house --  a creepy old Civil War-era    warehouse in the heart of the woods --  to regroup and review the tapes .^\n\nThey    soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night .   ^\n\nWacky hijinks ensue .^\n\nTristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the    Blair Witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on    their  bodies ,  Steven  and  Erica  have some highly disturbing mutual    hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket .   ^\n\nThroughout the entire ordeal , Jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize    the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at    about the point that the time jumps ;

we never saw anything , in fact .   ^\n\nThe horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to    envision what it might possibly be .^\n\nThis is the hallmark of a truly creepy    and disturbing horror movie .^\n\nBlair Witchdispensed with such niceties and    went straight for the gross-out .^\n\nThis was evident from the opening scenes of    the mad doctors forcing white goo down Jeffrey \'s  throat , and continued    throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and    disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort .   ^\n\nKnives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and    none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to    care .    ^\n\nThis movie did n\'t  stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke    and showed us everything .^\n\nBy the end of the movie , there are no questions    remaining about the missing five hours .^\n\nIt is all explained ; in fact , it is    all shown on-screen in loving detail .^\n\nI confess to being someone who prefers    horror  movies  in  which you never see the monster , or see only brief    glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ;

cv907_3193.txt,'Starring: Michael Keaton, Geena Davis, Christopher Reeve.^\n\nScreenplay : Robert    King .^\n\nDirector : Ron Underwood .    ^\n\nAll right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the    best-selling story , SPEECHLESS is not based on the romance between 1992    Presidential campaign rivals James Carville and Mary Matalin .^\n\nIn fact , the    script was in development well before 1992 .^\n\nStill , the comparisons are    inevitable , until one realizes a critical difference .^\n\nNo , it \'s  not that the    SPEECHLESS twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it \'s  that    Carville and Matalin \'s  story is actually interesting .^\n\nSPEECHLESS is a limp ,    poorly structured would-be romantic comedy .    ^\n\nSPEECHLESS is set during a New Mexico senatorial campaign , where Kevin    Vallick ( Michael Keaton ) and Julia Mann ( Geena Davis ) meet and get romantic    one night when neither one can sleep .^\n\nWhat neither one realizes is that they    are on opposite sides of the campaign : Kevin is a sit-com writer brought in    to punch up the Republican candidate \'s  speeches , while Julia is the chief    speech writer for the Democratic candidate .^\n\nAt first each one believes that    the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship , but eventually they    let down their guard and become closer .^\n\nBut there are plent of obstacles in    the way , including Julia \'s  stud-reporter fiance ( Christopher Reeve ) and a    series  of  stunts which continue to prove that all \'s  fair in love and    politics .    ^\n\nThe  standard  formula  for a movie like SPEECHLESS would have the two    principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that    they \'re  crazy about each other .^\n\nScreenwriter Robert King completely subverts    expectations by throwing Kevin and Julia into each other \'s  arms in the first    fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism .^\n\nIt \'s  a noble attempt to    shake things up , but unfortunately it just does n\'t  work .^\n\nPart of the fun of    watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry    even before the characters do , but in SPEECHLESS they already know they \'re     attracted to each other , and we \'re  left with waiting for the campaign to end    so  they \'ll   admit  that they love each other already .^\n\nThere is such a    herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even King \'s     sharp dialogue ca n\'t  prevent SPEECHLESS from becoming repetitive after about    half an hour .    ^\n\nInconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of    Geena Davis and Michael Keaton , and with those performances most of their    scenes together .^\n\nThe problems begin with their initial courtship , which does    virtually nothing to establish Julia \'s  character and merely establishes that    Kevin is a wise-ass .^\n\nDavis is radiantly beautiful , and Keaton is generally    entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens    to them seems to matter one bit .^\n\nIn a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment    sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection .^\n\nFor    the most part , however , they \'re  just actors spouting lines .^\n\nYou keep waiting    for a little spark , and it never happens .    ^\n\nPerhaps  most  disappointing  is  that King and director Ron Underwood    completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from SPEECHLESS \'s     politics .^\n\nThe setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes    with  partisanship thrown into the mix , but that \'s  never the tone that    Underwood is going for .^\n\nHe wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with Marc    Shaiman \'s  flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have    defined the conflict between Kevin and Julia fades into the background .^\n\nIt    might  as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single    character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be .    ^\n\nI was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy    Robert King \'s  previous screenplay , the Dana Carvey flop CLEAN SLATE , so I    had some hopes for SPEECHLESS .^\n\nBut while there is wit in the words , this is    a script which was probably much better on paper .^\n\nOn screen , it \'s  still    paper thin .

cv910_21930.txt,'http://twowebmasters.cjb.net (COMING SOON!)     >From writer and director Darren Stein comes Jawbreaker, the poorly told    tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong.^\n\nAt    Reagan High , four girls are sitting on top of the world .^\n\nCourtney Shane ,    played by Rose McGowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul    in  the school .^\n\nEveryone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her    popularity .^\n\nCourtney is the \" leader \" of her clique , which also includes    Julie , played by Rebecca Gayheart , Liz Purr , played by Charlotte Roldan , and    Marcie , played by Julie Benz are the other three in the group .^\n\nIt is Liz \'s     seventeenth birthday , and Julie , Courtney , and Marcie concur that they will    play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death    of Liz .    ^\n\nJust like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the    foursome  decide  to  cover up the death to make it look like a murder    committed by someone else .^\n\nAnd also just like in other teen directed movies ,    one of the four do n\'t  agree with hiding it , this time that character being    Julie .^\n\nAnd finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness    outside the group trying to hide the truth .^\n\nThis time that character being    Fern Mayo ( Judy Greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from Courtney \'s  group ,    as  well  as  the  entire  school. >From here , Jawbreaker turns into a    predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right    thing .    ^\n\nNot only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a    large amount of the main cast .^\n\nJudy Greer is undeniably awful as her one    dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has .^\n\nAlso on    the bad side of acting is Julie Benz , almost falling to the annoying factor    that Greer delivers .    ^\n\nOn the positive side of acting , Rose McGowan performs well here , but does n\'t     match  her  wickedly  clever performance as \" Tatum \" , in 1996\'s  Scream .   ^\n\nMcGowan \'s  role is annoying , but this only adds to the film .^\n\nShe is wickedly    mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her .   ^\n\nFaring  even  better  than  McGowan is Rebecca Gayheart , who is always    exceptionally believable as her roles .^\n\nWhen the script feeds her a one or    two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong    emotion and power into her roles .^\n\nGayheart is n\'t  given as much to do here as    she was in 1998\'s  Urban Legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her    acting skills in Jawbreaker .    ^\n\nJawbreaker  drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout , hardly    throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in .^\n\nWe get way off of the    topic  of the jawbreaker incident , and get into things that do n\'t  have    anything to do with the actual film .^\n\nThe beginning and ending are strong ,    it \'s  just the middle that needs a lot of help .^\n\nDuring the body of the movie ,    it is undeniably repetitive , never progressing towards a conclusion .^\n\nNothing    to grab the viewer \'s  interest is around , and the same , extremely annoying    song plays over and over again .    ^\n\nJawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film    Clueless , but falls flat .^\n\nThe few gags that actually work die off quickly    and die off with a bang .^\n\nAll in all , a horrible disappointment .    ^\n\nThe Bottom Line : The tagline reads , \" Even the sweetest candies are sour as    death inside . \"^\n\nYes , that is too true .^\n\nNo matter how good this film may have    looked , it fails to deliver .

cv911_21695.txt,'Sadly this like other movies this year was n\'t   good .  ^\n\nThis one being almost as bad as \' The Omega Code \' but not quite .  ^\n\nFrom the opening credits I had a good feeling this would be bad  , and well I guess I was right .  ^\n\nWith bad excuses for acting  , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction \' The Bachelor \' is a terribly unfunny movie that does n\'t   work on any levels accept that fact that Rene Zellwegar who does give a good performance .  ^\n\nThe two cameos by Brooke Shields and Mariah Carey are also good with Brooke being the best .  ^\n\nThe movie is troubled from the start because Chris O\'Donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date .  ^\n\nHere is the stupid plot  : Chris O\'Donnell plays Jimmie Shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend  , he meets Anne ( Rene Zellwegar  ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years .  ^\n\nJimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up .  ^\n\nHe really does n\'t   realize that Anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants I never did catch  ) .  ^\n\nSo he proposes in a really bad way  , and she shoots him down and is very mad .  ^\n\nHe of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any .  ^\n\nThen his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left Jimmie 100 million dollars  .... as long as he marries before the next day at 6:05 pm. Now Jimmie must find Anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her  , or get married to someone else to get the money itself  , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths .  ^\n\nOk so maybe this could be one of the dumbest  , cliched  , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs .  ^\n\nEven the supporting roles of Artie Lange  , Hal Holbrook and Ed Anser are n\'t   even good .  ^\n\nThe plot was a good idea  , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old .  ^\n\nThe choppy dialogue and bad directing do n\'t   help things any .  ^\n\nEven though Chris O\'Donnell gave an OK performance in the two Batman movies  , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and I wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him .  ^\n\nRene Zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming  , sweet and likable performance ( as usual  ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout .  ^\n\nHer sister played by Marley Shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen .  ^\n\nBrooke Shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old .  ^\n\nOne really ca n\'t   help but think that we have seen this stuff before .  ^\n\nIt \'s   not like this is an original idea and in the end  , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness .  ^\n\n\' The Bachelor \' works on no good levels and in fact does n\'t   work at all .  ^\n\nEd Anser and Hal Holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and Mariah Carey can not act to save her soul  , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career .  ^\n\nChris O\'Donnell is not as bad an actor as Casper Van Dien but that is not saying a great deal .  ^\n\nHe seems held back and really does n\'t   get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old .  ^\n\nArtie Lange just to me seems like he is trying to another Chris Farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving .  ^\n\nWhy the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie  , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know .  ^\n\nMaybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success  , and sometimes I do n\'t   agree with other critics on movies  , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts .  ^\n\nIts based on the 1925 silent film \' Seven Chances  \' which I am sure is very better than this mess .  ^\n\nEven though some may think of this as a good date movie  , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back .   ^\n\nBesides being a terrible movie  , \' The Bachelor \' is well a terrible movie .  ^\n\nIt has nothing worth recommending therefore I really ca n\'t   recommend this movie .  ^\n\nI did not have a good time and I laughed only three times .  ^\n\nThe running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes .  ^\n\nParts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time .  ^\n\nBeing one of the worst movies of the year  , we can be sure that I hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies  , and if they do they I give up on filmmakers .

( nearly all of it belongs in the Bad Movie Hall of Fame  )  ,  but I tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines  , like one  from the scene where Webb unwinds from a hard day \'s   work by  going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice  ) .  ^\n\nHe meets a  woman who  , coincidentally  , also orders tomato juice but walks away  from a typically-stimulating conversation with Webb to flirt with his  arch-rival  , another Marine D.I. Webb marches over to the table  , gets  up in her face and says  ,  \" Just what kind of a dame do you think you  are  ?  \"  ^\n\nBogart he ai n\'t   .        ^\n\nThe other D.I. gets one of the few memorable non-Webb  lines when he confesses to the girl  ,  \" He \'s   a damn good D.I.   ...  ^\n\nI  guess I \'m   just a little jealous .  \"  ^\n\nJoin the club  , we \'re   all jealous of  Jack Webb \'s   way with women  , which is showcased even more  amusingly in a later scene  , as Webb finds his way to the woman \'s    place of employment  , a lingerie store  , and stands around looking  incredibly flustered at the negligees on display .  ^\n\n\" You expect me to  talk to you   ... in _here_  ?  !  \" he exclaims  , no doubt intimidated by the  barrage of bras .          ^\n\nThe woman goes off to help a customer  , leaving Webb  to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen .  ^\n\nA little  girl spots him in the store and demands  ,  \" What are you doing in  here   ... you \'re   a man  , are n\'t   you  ?  \"  ^\n\nHe does n\'t   reply  , but you know  he \'s   thinking in his head  ,  \" What an odd species of human --   so  small .  ^\n\nMust be one of those children everyone \'s   been talking  about .  \"  ^\n\nThis poor girl  , scarred for life by her early encounter with  Jack Webb  , would later swear off the male gender entirely  , just one  of the many lesbian conversions he \'s   responsible for .          ^\n\nThe movie does n\'t   focus too closely on Webb \'s   romance  , it  also continues the Owens subplot with probably the most memorable  scene in the entire movie  , where Webb forces his platoon to spend  the entire night searching the ground for a flea Owens killed during  one of their drills .  ^\n\nAfter two privates hatch a scheme to present  Webb with the wrong dead flea  , Webb asks Owens  ,  \" Was that flea  you killed a male or female  ?  \"  ^\n\nOwens replies  ,  \" A male  , sir .  \"  ^\n\nWebb  yells to the platoon  ,  \" This ai n\'t   the one  !  \"  ^\n\nThat such a scene ( along  with the rest of the movie  ) was intended to be taken seriously defies  comment .          ^\n\nBut we know it was all presented with the utmost  seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the Marines not  only for their cooperation in the making of THE D.I.  , but for Iwo  Jima  , Guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of  the 20th century .  ^\n\nWebb held the military in such high esteem that  all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of Owens  ) were  played by actual Marines .  ^\n\nSomeone wanting to parody this movie  could n\'t   do a more comical job than Webb did .          ^\n\nIt makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your  wedding day  ) that the man had no sense of humor himself .  ^\n\nThere \'s    a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time  discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter .   ^\n\nWebb bursts in the room and shouts  ,  \" What did I tell you about  laughing  ?  !  \" to which the private replies  ,  \" Sir  , only nine-year-old  girls laugh  , sir  !  \"  ^\n\nAnd let me tell you  , I was as happy as a nine-year- old girl while watching this movie  .'

cv919_18155.txt,'In the mid-1980s  , following the splendid debut in Hugh Hudson \'s   GREYSTOKE and relative success of first HIGHLANDER film  , it looked like Christopher Lambert \'s   acting career might go somewhere .  ^\n\nBut  , it was n\'t   meant to be  , which became obvious following HIGHLANDER II .  ^\n\nIn this decade Christopher Lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality .  ^\n\nVery often such films were science fiction  , which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring Christopher Lambert .  ^\n\nWhether it was because of real lack of talent  , terrible miscasting or simple bad luck is n\'t   important - the end result was almost always horrible .  ^\n\nThe same can be said for FORTRESS  , 1993 science fiction film directed by Stuart Gordon  , director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like REANIMATOR and FROM BEYOND .  ^\n\nThe movie is set in 2018 .  ^\n\nFor some undisclosed reason  , USA introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child .  ^\n\nJake ( Christopher Lambert  ) and Karen Brennick ( Lori Laughlin  ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border .  ^\n\nSentenced to 31 years in prison  , they are both thrown into Fortress  , privately owned correctional facility  , equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called Zed .  ^\n\nAlthough equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates  \' lives and make any escape impossible  , prison authorities often use violence .  ^\n\nJake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape .  ^\n\nSuch escape should become necessity  , because the warden Poe ( Kurtwood Smith  ) begins showing unhealthy interest in Karen .  ^\n\nAfter rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison  , this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity .  ^\n\nThe reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clichs and situations that are painfully predictable .  ^\n\nBy the time Brennick begins his escape from Fortress  , those situations not only begin to look predictable  , but utterly implausible too .  ^\n\nOf course  , film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society .  ^\n\nThe initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters  , played by not too interested or talented actors .  ^\n\nLori Laughlin  , although physically attractive  , shows the acting ability of sequoia .  ^\n\nKurtwood Smith as prison warden is rather uninspired  , capable of solid  , yet forgettable performance .  ^\n\nLambert \'s   performance is also good  , but even the bigger talent could n\'t   help this film  , destined to end in oblivion .

cv921_13988.txt,'At the end of the day  , those reflecting upon the debacle that is THE    AVENGERS would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on    the horizon for the project well before Warner Bros. made the    contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped    plans for a gala premiere .   ^\n\nThis highly-anticipated film rendition    of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early June    opening  , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival    studios  \' heavy hitters  ; its eventual demotion to a less potent    mid-August opening was an obvious early indication of the studio \'s      lack of confidence with the picture .     ^\n\nAnd with good reason .   ^\n\nThis is a joyless exercise of a film  , held    together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of    excitement  , thrills or wit .   ^\n\nRemarkable in its banality and brutally    uninvolving  , THE AVENGERS is a catastrophic mess which immediately    invites comparisons to last year \'s   case study in style over    substance  , Joel Schumacher \'s   much-loathed BATMAN & ROBIN .   ^\n\n( Indeed  ,    both films even feature appalling  , ridiculous sequences which find    central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes .  )     ^\n\nUma Thurman  , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad  ,    karate-chopping Emma Peel immortalized by Diana Rigg  , was the only    bright spot in the aforementioned Schumacher disaster  , imbuing her    Poison Ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences    something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage .   ^\n\nUnfortunately  ,    the same ca n\'t   be said here  , where she and cohort Ralph Fiennes ( our    new John Steed  , taking over for Patrick Macnee  ) demonstrate no    appreciable chemistry whatsoever  , fatally crippling the picture as    they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade    double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully    aware that they \'re   on board a sinking ship .   ^\n\nAt this rate  ,    usually-splendid actor Mr. Fiennes may never make the transition from    Arthouse Apollo to mainstream leading man --   his tepid turn here will    make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the    regrettably-neglected Kathyrn Bigelow film STRANGE DAYS .     ^\n\nThe duo *look* the part --   and admittedly THE AVENGERS is  , more than    most  , heavily dependent upon style --   but they \'re   no fun to watch  ,    and I found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the    lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they    navigated through the picture \'s   caper-esque plot .   ^\n\nWhen not checking    my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat  , I began to alleviate    the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the    filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile EMMA as our Mrs.    Peel --   no  , not Kate Beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues    me  )  , but Gwyneth Paltrow  , who was originally in the running for the    part and can veritably handle a spot-on English accent .   ^\n\nIf nothing    else  , it \'d   at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight    of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt .     ^\n\nThe story  , such as it is  , involves the ever-bemused tandem of Steed    and Peel combating the malevolent Sir August de Wynter ( Sean    Connery  )  , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the    nation with his climate-controlling contraption .   ^\n\n( They also sip a    lot of tea .  )   ^\n\nOverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky    hijinx involving our protagonists  \' superiors  , it sounds far better    than it plays  , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant    post-production tinkering  ; it \'s   clearly evident that the picture has    been cut to shreds .   ^\n\nTHE AVENGERS was never about gripping drama  , and    our heroes accordingly never take villainous Sir August very    seriously  , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of    menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac  , it \'s   all decidedly    uncompelling .   ^\n\nMr. Connery  , who \'s   onscreen barely long enough to    register an impression  , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a    contractual obligation  , simultaneously chewing the scenery while    unable to hide his disinterest .     ^\n\nAt least it all looks good .   ^\n\nThis is a genuinely handsome production  ,    with fine costume design by Anthony Powell and crisply shot by Roger    Pratt .   ^\n\nIn particular  , the gleaming production design by Stuart Craig    commands attention  , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in    order to depict this Great Britain .   ^\n\nThere are a handful of striking    visual moments in the film  , including an attack by a swarm of giant    robotic bees and a nice shot of Steed and Peel finding a way to walk    on water  , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these    instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates .   ^\n\nBy the time    the film \'s   climax had arrived  , my interest was not with the sight of    Steed and Sir August slugging it out amidst crashing waves and    thundering rain  , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre .     ^\n\nNot coincidentally  , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the    shots assembled into the movie \'s   remarkable trailer  , a savvy piece of    work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature    film itself  ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is    probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year .   ^\n\nIt \'s      everything that THE AVENGERS is not --   saucy  , clever  , engaging  , and    entertaining .   ^\n\nA crushing disappointment  , the film is one of the    worst outings of the year --   too drearily awful to be savoured as    gleefully bad  , too polished to overlook its deficiencies .   ^\n\nThere may    be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than THE AVENGERS  ,    but I sure hope not  .'

cv926_18471.txt,'A fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review .   ^\n\nI \'ve   attempted to obey this rule in recent months  , but to do so would be impossible in this case .   ^\n\nThe fact is  , nearly every person who goes to see The Phantom Menace brings baggage in with them .   ^\n\nThe original Star Wars trilogy means so much to so many people .   ^\n\nFor me  , they calibrated my creativity as a child  ; they are masterful  , original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time ( and they still hold up pretty darn well  ) .   ^\n\nI am too young to have seen Star Wars in the theater during its original release  , but that does n\'t   make me any less dedicated to it .   ^\n\nOn the contrary  , the Star Wars trilogy --   and The Empire Strikes Back in particular --   are three items on a very short list of why I love movies .  ^\n\nWhen I heard that George Lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine-film series  , I got exited .   ^\n\nWhen I first saw screenshots from the film  , well over a year ago  , I embarked on a year-long drool of anticipation .   ^\n\nAnd when the first previews were released last Thanksgiving  , I was ready to see the film .   ^\n\nBut then there was the Hype  , the insane marketing campaign  , and Lucasfilm \'s   secretive snobbery over the picture .   ^\n\nIn the last weeks before the picture opened  , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater  , I was tired of hearing about it .   ^\n\nI was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever I went to KFC or Taco Bell .   ^\n\nI just wanted to see the movie .   ^\n\nReader  , do not misunderstand .   ^\n\nI did not have an anti-Hype reaction .   ^\n\nThe Hype was unavoidable .   ^\n\nI understand and accept the Hype --   it \'s   just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released .    ^\n\nFive minutes into The Phantom Menace  , I knew there was a problem .   ^\n\n\" Who are these Jedi knights  ?  \"  ^\n\nI asked .   ^\n\n\" Why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity  ?  \"   ^\n\n\" Why are n\'t   these characters being developed before their adventures  ?  \"   ^\n\n\" Why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film  ?  \"   ^\n\nThese were just some of my questions early on .   ^\n\nLater  , I asked  ,  \" Where \'s   the magic of the first three films  ?  \" and  \" Why am I looking at my watch every fifteen minutes  ? \'   ^\n\nBy the end of the film  , I was tired  , maddened  , and depressed .  ^\n\nGeorge Lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless  , mindless  , summer blockbuster .   ^\n\nThe Phantom Menace is no Star Wars film .   ^\n\nTake away the title and the Jedi talk and the Force  , and you \'re   left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time .   ^\n\nIt \'s   an embarrassment .   ^\n\nI looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored  , or a new theme is examined  , or a special effects shot is n\'t   used .   ^\n\nThere are a few of each  , but they \'re   all token attempts .   ^\n\nThe fact is  , George Lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects .   ^\n\nThis is not what I wanted to see .   ^\n\nI did n\'t   want to leave The Phantom Menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth  , but I did .  ^\n\nThe story centers mostly around Qui-Gon Jinn ( Liam Neeson  , looking lost and confused  ) and his apprentice  , Obi-Wan Kenobi ( Ewan McGregor  , who scarcely has a line in the film  ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet Naboo .   ^\n\nNaboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the Trade Federation  ; their contact on Naboo is Queen Amidala ( Natalie Portman  )  , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people .   ^\n\nAfter picking up Jar Jar Binks ( a completely CGI character  , voiced by Ahmed Best  )  , they head to Tatooine  , where they meet young Anakin Skywalker ( Jake Lloyd  ) and his mother ( Pernilla August  ) .   ^\n\nQui-Gon knows that the Force is strong with young Anakin  , and so the Jedi Knights take the boy with them on their journeys .   ^\n\nThe bad guys are Darth Maul and Darth Sidious  , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters .  ^\n\nThere is n\'t   anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form .   ^\n\nThe way Lucas has handled it  , however  , it unsatisfactory .   ^\n\nFirst of all  , we do n\'t   learn one single thing about Qui-Gon Jinn .   ^\n\nNot one thing .   ^\n\nWhat was his life like before this film  ?   ^\n\nWell  , I imagine he did n\'t   have one .   ^\n\nThat \'s   why he feels like a plot device .   ^\n\nThis probably explains why Neeson looks so hopeless in the role  , and why he \'s   recently retired from film ( I do n\'t   blame him  , honestly  ) .   ^\n\nObi-Wan  , a character I was really looking forward to learning more about  , is even less interesting .   ^\n\nMcGregor has just a few lines  , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere .   ^\n\nSince these two men are the focus of The Phantom Menace  , Lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie .    ^\n\nThings start to pick up when our characters reach Tatooine  ; young Anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film  , and Lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role .   ^\n\nI was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene  ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting .   ^\n\nAnd when Anakin says goodbye to his mother  , I found it moving .   ^\n\nAlso fairly good is Portman  , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written .   ^\n\nJar Jar Binks is one of the most annoying characters I \'ve   ever had to endure  , but he \'s   more interesting than most of the humans .  ^\n\nAs soon as the relatively-brief segment on Tatooine is over  , it \'s   back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes .   ^\n\nI \'ve   seen many movies that qualify as  \" special effects extravaganzas  ,  \" but The Phantom Menace is the first one I \'ve   seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie .   ^\n\nThe reason is obvious  :  George Lucas has no restraint .   ^\n\nI ca n\'t   say that I did n\'t   find the effects original  , because I did --   the final battle between Darth Maul  , Obi-Wan  , and Qui-Gon is visually exceptional  , as is most of the film .   ^\n\nBut I also found the effects deadening and tiresome .   ^\n\nMy breaking point was near the end of the picture  , as Anakin is getting questioned by Yoda and the other Jedi masters  ; in the background  , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky  , and I wanted that to go away .   ^\n\nCa n\'t   we have one stinking scene that is n\'t   bursting at the seems with a special effects shot  ?   ^\n\nI got so sick of looking at the CGI characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that I really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours .    ^\n\nAnd then there \'s   the question of magic .   ^\n\nWhat was lost in the sixteen years between The Phantom Menace and Return of the Jedi  ?   ^\n\nI have a feeling that Lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel .   ^\n\nJohn Williams  \' familiar score is no help  , nor is Lucas  \' direction .   ^\n\nI think it comes right down to characters  :  there are none here .   ^\n\nI longed for the magnetic presence of Han  , Luke  , and Leia  , but I got no such thing .   ^\n\nAnd what about the ridiculous expectations  ?   ^\n\nMine were n\'t   that high  ; I simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that I grew up loving  , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects .   ^\n\nInstead  , I got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show .   ^\n\nI do n\'t   hate The Phantom Menace as much as I resent it  :  I \'d   like to forget that it exists  , and yet I ca n\'t   . ^\n\nIt \'s   here to stay .   ^\n\nI can only hope that Episodes II and III have something of substance in them  , because if they do n\'t    , then Lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series .

McGinley  ) shoots the cheif of the Inuit clan  , and Chen and Seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory  ... literally  , of course .   ^\n\nAt one point  , Seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he does n\'t   have any options but blow stuff up .   ^\n\nHe even goes as far as to say  ,  \" I do n\'t   want to kill someone  ,  \" and in the same breath  , he asks some guy where the arsenal is .  ^\n\nI have no problem with violence .   ^\n\nI \'m   a huge John Woo fan  , but he paints his films with suspense  , skill  , style  , depth  , characterization  , and just plain cool violence .   ^\n\nIn the films of Seagal  , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly  , and him either wounding or killing them .   ^\n\nAt some points  , they use the cliche of the talking villain  , where the villain has the advantage  , can shoot Seagal  , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan  , or saying a corny line  , to which Seagal says something hokey back  , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them  , and does .   ^\n\nThis would be okay if there were any suspense or if it did n\'t   take itself seriously at all  , like in the case of this summer \'s    \" Con Air .  \"   ^\n\nBut Seagal is serious about his skill  , and of course  , his message .  ^\n\nI would n\'t   mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence .   ^\n\nBut Seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle  , not pounded into the viewer \'s   mind .   ^\n\nThe villain is totally shallow and cartoonish  , thus we ca n\'t   take him and his motives seriously  , and while Seagal talks about being kind to the environment  , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig  , and kills some workers who were just doing his job .   ^\n\nThen at the end  , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech  , just in case you did n\'t   get the message from the trailers .   ^\n\nWhat Seagal does n\'t   realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do  ) and any message he has is no only redundant  , but does n\'t   comfortably fit in his film  , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence  , crap suspense  , stupid melodrama  , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish .  ^\n\nAs far as Seagal and his acting  , he \'s   rather boring .   ^\n\nHe squints  , he kills .   ^\n\nPeriod .   ^\n\nNothing else .   ^\n\nOh  , yeah  , there \'s   corny one-liners (  \" I \'m   gonna reach out and touch someone  !  \"  ) .   ^\n\nOf course  , he \'s   the star  , and we \'re   supposed to root for him and all  , so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks .   ^\n\nMichael Caine  , who \'s   a great actor  , is just supposed to yell and look cold .   ^\n\nHe does it well  , I guess  , but this is no  \" Alfie .  \"   ^\n\nOf coure  , no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him .   ^\n\nHis big henchman  , John C. McGinley is kinda boring as well  , but is not horrible .   ^\n\nAnd we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid  , R. Lee Ermey ( from  \" Full Metal Jacket  \"  ) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous Seagal is  , just for the movie trailers and for Seagal \'s   ego .   ^\n\nAnd also  , look for Billy Bob Thornton as one of Ermey \'s   assasins .  ^\n\nAnyway  , to conclude this all  , to judge one of Seagal \'s   movies is to judge all of them ( except for  \" Under Siege  \" and  \" Executive Decision  ,  \" though the latter is not really a  \" Seagal movie  \"  ) .   ^\n\nThey all have this same formula  , they all have the same action  , same villain  , same plot  , but this one has that message  , which makes it more excrucitating to watch .   ^\n\nI mean  , if you do rent it  , and I do n\'t   reccomend you do  , make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes .   ^\n\nBut I have to put it to Seagal for creating a film so bad  , that the last film I viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one .

Mapother (Wallis), 2000)     M: I-2, the sequel to Mission Impossible, is a James Bond wannabe film, but    it fails to even come close to that film in wit, humor, and entertainment    value.^\n\nIt tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film    just looks like it \'s  an extended commercial for dudes who think they look    cool in throwaway sunglasses .^\n\nIt is a film that prefers techie gadgets to    anything human .^\n\nThe coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had    in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of    doves throughout as peace symbols .^\n\nThe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy    dream about techie violence .^\n\nExcept for the choreographed action sequences ,    the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead    spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the    superficial romance that developed .^\n\nAs for the action scenes , they might    look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their    advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon    violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without    feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen .    ^\n\nM : I-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get    past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue .^\n\nThe film looks    as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point .^\n\nThe only thing    that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by Hans Zimmer that    became very loud at any of the film \'s  supposedly momentous action scenes and    seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way .    ^\n\nIt \'s  a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry TV series .   ^\n\nBut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it    hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce    a story that had any substance .^\n\nJohn Woo ( \" Broken Arrow \" /\"Face/Off \" ) is    good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu    kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just    ca n\'t   seem  to handle dialogue and suspense .^\n\nThe star of the film and    co-producer , Tom Cruise , and his romantic interest , Thandie Newton , are    miscast . ^\n\nCruise  is no James Bond and looks more like a yuppie than a    superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry    off this macho role , while Thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems    like a fish- out-of-water in this one .^\n\nTheir romance did n\'t  work , not only    was it tepid and not sexy , but it was n\'t  convincing .    ^\n\nThe film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled    audience  is  its  best bet for success .^\n\nWe will be in three different    locations instantaneously : Sydney , the American Southwest , and Seville .   ^\n\nFirst , we are in Sydney , Australia , where a scientist with a muffled Russian    accent , Dr. Nekhorvich ( Rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer    virus called Chimera and an antidote for it .^\n\nHe also mentions that every    hero needs a worthy villain .^\n\nWhich explains the film \'s  mythic theme ... as we    enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil .    ^\n\nThe one who played the villain , Dougray Scott , does so in a one-dimensional    gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role .^\n\nAt least , if the    film  got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this    nonsense .    ^\n\nSoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts    called Dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on    automatic pilot and crash it into the Rocky Mountains .^\n\nBefore they crash the    plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as Dimitri , turns out    to be Sean Ambrose ( Scott ) , a rogue member of the IMF , which is a CIA-like    clone .^\n\nHe steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask ,    which is a replica of the hero of the story , Ethan Hunt ( Cruise ) , who had    posed as Dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust .   ^\n\nSean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a    virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at    marked up prices .    ^\n\nWe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in Face/Off and in the    original Mission Impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it    was still a superior film to this sequel .^\n\nWoo has run this peeling mask    routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides ,    so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy    or villain .^\n\nIt makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which    distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to    make much sense .    ^\n\nNext we are in a mountain range in the American Southwest , and Ethan is on    vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a    helicopter with his boss Anthony Hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket    launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses .^\n\nHunt learns his next mission is to    retrieve the Chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular IMF    agents to help , Billy Baird ( John Polson ) and Luther Stickell ( Ving Rhames ) ,    with Luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel    thief  named  Nyah  Hall ( Thandie ) to join his team .^\n\nHe is told , as an    incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped .^\n\nHopkins    then signs off with the tag line:This message will self-destruct in five    seconds .^\n\nActually , with the departure of Hopkins , it was this disposable    film that actually self-destructed at this point .    ^\n\nIn Seville , Hunt recruits Nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist    and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her Audi sports car over    the  side of a mountain road .^\n\nHe also falls for her when this was only    supposed to be a business

cv934_20426.txt,'Ex-Universal Soldier Luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad .  ^\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme has a one-liner early on in Universal Soldier  : The Return  , his latest attempt to remain relevant  , that sums up this entire movie  ; he says  \" Been there  , done that .  \"  ^\n\nNo film critic could possibly sum up Van Damme \'s   recent film choices any better .  ^\n\nWhile other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( Schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films  )  , Van Damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him  : martial arts and guns .  ^\n\nThis unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused Van Damme to enter the straight to video world  , with Legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex .  ^\n\nHe joins fellow martial artist/action star Steven Seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away .      ^\n\nUniversal Soldier  : The Return is truly poor .  ^\n\nThe plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade  , specifically Terminator 2  : Judgement Day and the similarly named Soldier .  ^\n\nSoldier \'s   Kurt Russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors  , for the good of a planet  ; Schwarzenegger \'s   Terminator in T2 tried to save John Connor from a newer model killing machine  , the T-1000  ; and Jean-Claude  , a former Universal Soldier  , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of  , you guessed it  , newer model Soldiers .  ^\n\nConsidering the poor box office performance of Soldier  , it \'s   amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead .      ^\n\nLuc Devereaux ( Van Damme  ) was the sole remaining Universal Soldier ( or Unisol for short  )  , until he was returned to a normal  , if muscular  , human form .  ^\n\nIn this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series  , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise  )  , Luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the UNISOL program .  ^\n\nWorking with Dylan Cotner ( Xander Berkeley  , who interestingly also appeared in T2  )  , the UNISOL program has engineered a tougher  , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer SETH .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government  , SETH takes control of his soldiers  , killing everyone in the building except for Luc  , his partner Maggie  , his daughter Hillary and Erin  , a reporter trapped inside .  ^\n\nThe rest of the film involves Luc trying to keep them all alive  , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers  , most notably Romeo ( popular wrestler Goldberg  ) .  ^\n\nThere are lots of fights  , gun battles  , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility .      ^\n\nThere are so many clichs in this film that it is almost painful to watch .  ^\n\nLuc gets saddled with the task of saving Erin the reporter early on  , and in the course of a single night  , they go from bickering to falling for each other  , to kissing .  ^\n\nErin is a pathetically-written character  ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her  , and yet  , not only does this not seem to frighten her  , but she finds time to remind Luc that she  \" is n\'t   leaving without her story  \" .  ^\n\nWhatever .  ^\n\nOther laughable moments include a  ) Luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what  ?  ) and b  ) a group of Rangers  , who after having been given good advice ( Luc tells them that their weapons are useless  , and shows them a specific gun which should work better  )  , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle  ?  ) .  ^\n\nNot one single scene in Universal Soldier  : The Return has any originality to it .      ^\n\nWhen fuelled by Don Davis  \' loud  , driving music score  , the film \'s   many fights become almost passable  , but mostly are full of the same ol \' Jean-Claude moves .  ^\n\nDirector Mic Rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator  ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace  , with only a few token serious moments to be found .  ^\n\nHis past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows  , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion .  ^\n\nIf only Jean-Claude were n\'t   getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like Jet Li  , Rodgers could probably have made a decent action film .      ^\n\nTo place the blame squarely at Van Damme \'s   feet  , however  , is an injustice .  ^\n\nI \'m   not sure that anyone  , not even Robert DeNiro or Edward Norton  , could make writers William Malone and John Fasano \'s   script sound good .  ^\n\nOne particularly painful scene is when Erin asks Luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access .  ^\n\nHe cringes  , looks down and mutters  \" uh  ... uhm   ... they all do  , I saw it on 60 Minutes. eh he he he  \" The script \'s   and indeed the entire film \'s   only saving grace is Goldberg .  ^\n\nHe chews up every scene he is in  , obviously enjoying his role immensely .  ^\n\nHe even gives the film a few laughs  , as he mutters things like  \" I really do n\'t   like that guy  \" every time he fails to kill Luc .  ^\n\nSadly  , his presence is not enough to turn Universal Soldier  : The Return into anything better than a below-average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight-to-video  .'

   Malcolm-as-Momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; Malcolm    trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune    moments ; Malcolm delivering a baby because Big Momma is the town midwife    ( one of the few sequences that works ) .^\n\nMartin Lawrence can be likeable    enough at times , but there \'s  no reason to care a whit about his budding    romance with Sherry because Malcolm is never an independently significant    character .^\n\nHe \'s  just Big Momma without the makeup on .    ^\n\nI wo n\'t  waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped    convict  is  employed ,  since  it  was  clearly a waste of time to the    film-makers .^\n\nThere are a few token scenes of Lester looming as a threatening    figure , but he \'s  ultimately a distraction in a film that \'s  really about its    central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at Nia    Long \'s  posterior ) .^\n\nI \'m  never prepared to underestimate how appealing that    idea may be to other people --  several million of them apparently found Adam    Sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing --  but I know that when    a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it \'s  an entire    film , I duck out of the way .^\n\nThe gross implausibility of BIG MOMMA \'S  HOUSE    might   have  been  tolerable  if  it  was  seasoned  with  more  big ,    cleverly-constructed  laughs . ^\n\nIts  lack of big laughs might have been    tolerable if its characters were at all relevant .^\n\nBIG MOMMA \'S  HOUSE is    ridiculous  _and_  not  funny . ^\n\nIt \'s   just a sad exercise in the jaded    presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it    involves Martin Lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \n'
cv936_17473.txt,'Starring William Baldwin; Cindy Crawford & Steven Berkoff All right, the    first problem that Fair Game has is the casting of supermodel Cindy Crawford    in the lead role.^\n\nNot that Cindy does that bad , it \'s  just that anyone who    watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was    not  done  because of Cindy \'s  extraordinary acting skills , but for her    extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation .^\n\nAnd in    Fair Game most situations tend to find Cindy either soaking wet or very hot    and sweaty , but I \'m  sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that    these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that Cindy looks    great wet , well , that \'s  just a happy coincidence .^\n\nSure .^\n\nWilliam Baldwin    is n\'t  a bad actor .^\n\nUnfortunately , he just does n\'t  demonstrate it at all in    this movie .^\n\nI \'m  not sure if that \'s  because most of his lines were just so    hokey , or if he was trying to make Cindy \'s  acting look good .^\n\nIf it was the    latter , it worked .^\n\nCindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first    movie .^\n\nWhich is not to say that she does n\'t  have room for improvement .   ^\n\nAlthough to be fair to Cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places .    ^\n\nSo right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does    Cindy Crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for    her foray into the world of cinema ?^\n\nWell , I \'m  glad you asked that question .   ^\n\nCindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for    former elite KGB agents .^\n\nWhy woud they target someone as likable as Cindy ,    you ask ?^\n\nBy the end of the movie you wo n\'t  care .^\n\nThe story is so contrived    it is n\'t  funny .^\n\nAnyway after Cindy gets blown out of the window of her    house , without getting so much as a scratch I might add , she is placed into    protective police custody under the watchful eve of William Baldwin .^\n\nWho \'s     character , Max Kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of    some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way    too many of Steven Seagal \'s  early films ) .^\n\nThe point is that the idea of the    Crawford and Baldwin \'s  characters of the run from these killer Russians    is n\'t  all that bad of an idea , it \'s  just everything around that basic idea    which kinda stinks out loud .    ^\n\nThe supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes .^\n\nIf    I was Baldwin , I \'d  hope this film disappears .^\n\nAs for Crawford , she may    indeed  have  some acting ability .^\n\nUnfortunately , any she does have is    obscured by writing that goes beyond bad .    ^\n\nThis movie was obviously written with Cindy in mind , since the writers spend    most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks .^\n\nIt \'s  too bad    they had n\'t  spent more time on a half decent plot , since Ms. Crawford is    more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much .   ^\n\nUnless you are a huge fan of either Baldwin or Crawford this is a movie that    will only disappoint you .

cv942_18509.txt,'At first glance, I thought that The Sword And The Sorceror had promise.^\n\nIts    plotline goes like this : The evil King Cromwell , desiring to take over the    world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , Xusia for power .^\n\nHe attacks the    kingdom  of  Eh-Dan  and  kills  young Prince Talon \'s  parents .^\n\nGiven a    triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying    father , Talon vows for revenge .^\n\nEleven years later , when he \'s  established    his own army , the Mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom .^\n\nAlong the    way , he meets up with Alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and    her brother is kidnapped by Cromwell .^\n\nTalon vows to help , and , after a    series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing Alana \'s  brother ( and    several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put    on a Cross to be crucified ! ) .^\n\nFortunately he frees himself , rescues Alana    from marrying Cromwell , defeats Xusia , and then Cromwell , all with his    triple bladed sword ( During the final battle , the blade breaks , but Talon    finishes  Cromwell  off  by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) .^\n\nThen ,    everything ends happily .    ^\n\nUnfortunately , The Sword And The Sorcerer is not even half as good as it    sounds .^\n\nWhat would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven    plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes .^\n\nNever once    does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly .    ^\n\nThis problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where Cromwell    resurrects Xusia .^\n\nAfter telling him that he needs his help , he leads the    warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a    cliff afterwards .^\n\nWait a minute , did n\'t  the plotline say that he needs the    help of Xusia in order to invade Eh-Dan , which he cannot do by military    force ?^\n\nIf that is the case , why does he dispose of Xusia after resurrecting    him ?^\n\nAnd why does he manage to take over Eh-Dan anyway ?^\n\nThese questions are    just NEVER - no , NEVER - answered in the film .    ^\n\nAnother example is that one moment we see Talon fighting for his life ,    another moment we see him just about to be crucified during Alana \'s  wedding    to Cromwell( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with Alana ,    he just tells her to \" wait \" , and then he just rides off !^\n\nIn addition to the    extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what    would have been a great fantasy adventure .^\n\nEven some attempts to make it    exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , do n\'t  work .^\n\nIt just completely    fails altogether miserably .    ^\n\nThe only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by    David Whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career .^\n\nThe    score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than    this film is .^\n\nMy suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and    buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) .    ^\n\nIronically , though , before the film \'s  credits roll , there is a message    indicating that a sequel , Tales Of The Ancient Empire , would follow .^\n\nTo my    relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because The Sword And    The Sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $ 39 million .    ^\n\nCritics were right on in slamming The Sword And The Sorcerer , all right .   ^\n\nLeonard Maltin rightfully called it \" second rate in scripting , and acting \"    and At-A-Glance Film Reviews called it \" a confusing , stupid , unimaginative ,    unengaging , bloodfilled bore \" .^\n\nI totally agree with these reviews , all    right , and I hope that this piece of #$ \% ! will be forgotten about .^\n\nThere are    FAR better fantasy movies than The Sword And The Sorcerer .^\n\nI hope you get a    good laugh out of this review , but I am not laughing .^\n\nIn fact , my insults    do n\'t   even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me    throughout its 100 minute running time .

cv943_23547.txt,'This movie stinks!^\n\nAlthough it is professionally crafted and there are some    decent performances , the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss .^\n\nI    knew I was in for trouble when , during the opening establishment shots , we    see a detailed close-up of Warrant Officer Paul Brenner \'s  ( John Travolta )    military identification card and it is the wrong color .^\n\nThis might seem like    a minor detail , but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows    that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are    yellow .^\n\nAnd what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so    wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training .^\n\nOr what    about when Brenner tells a suspect that , because he is in the military , he    does n\'t  have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights    were central to military law well before the Miranda decision .^\n\nHow hard is    it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts ?^\n\nNow    details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up , but    this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through .^\n\nFor example , at    the beginning of the film , Paul Brenner , an undercover Army investigator ,    gets into a gun and knife battle at his off-post houseboat and winds-up    killing  an  arms  dealer  he had been investigating .^\n\nThe local police    investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover    that  Brenner has been lying to them about the killing .^\n\nBut instead of    arresting him , or at least take him into custody for further questioning ,    they release him .^\n\nDuh !^\n\nUltimately , Brenner gets assigned to investigate the    murder and possible rape of the commanding general \'s  daughter , a young    captain also assigned to the post .^\n\nWhen Brenner finds graphic sex tapes    featuring the general \'s  daughter , does he use them to generate a suspect    list and begin grilling suspects .^\n\nNo , his instinct is to suppress them    because  they  might  be potentially embarrassing .^\n\nEventually , Brenner    discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at West Point    eight years earlier .^\n\nI wo n\'t  even go into the totally unbelievable rationale    for the Army \'s  suppression of this horrendous crime .^\n\nI will just mention one    final flaw .^\n\nBrenner is investigating a crime that occurred in Georgia .^\n\nThe    rape occurred in West Point , which is in New York .^\n\nHe is under a very tight    ( and totally implausible ) 36-hour deadline to solve this case .^\n\nHe needs to    discuss  the rape with a psychiatrist at West Point .^\n\nDoes he phone the    doctor ?^\n\nNo , he travels ( via some unexplained very fast transport ) to New    York to question the psychiatrist in person , and then he returns to Georgia    ( again by the miracle transport ) , without once worrying about the impact any    of this will have on his deadline .^\n\nYou have been warned , stay away from this    one .    ^\n'
cv944_15042.txt,'\"It was not scary.\"^\n\nThese are the first words that came to mind after it was    over .^\n\nWhen a movie is called _Vampires_ , \" not scary \" are n\'t  words that    should be associated with it .^\n\nBut that was n\'t  my only gripe .^\n\nJohn Carpenter    is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema , as in the intense scares of    _Halloween_ , _The Thing_ and _The Prince of Darkness_ , or the offbeat action    of _They Live_ and _Escape From New York_ .^\n\nUnfortunately , the only thing    that is cutting edge about _Vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is    able to reach .^\n\nWith an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects ,    _John Carpenter \'s  Vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst    of even the least discerning genre fan .    ^\n\nThe film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers , led    by James Woods , of all people .^\n\nLike some sort of holy A-Team ( they even have    their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires    in  a  New  Mexico  shack . ^\n\nTheir  method is amusingly innovative : the    blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun    like matchsticks .    ^\n\nTo commemorate their victory , the loutish band decorates a motel room with    hookers  and parties the night away .^\n\nTheir celebration is short-lived ,    however ,  as a master vampire named Valek ambushes and single-handedly    destroys  most of the team .^\n\nWoods \' Jack Crow and buddy Montoya ( Daniel    Baldwin ) escape with their lives , along with a woman named Katrina ( Sheryl    Lee ) .^\n\nAlthough the woman has been bitten , Montoya and Crow decide to keep    Katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire .    ^\n\nThe rest of the movie is concerned with the boys \' hunt for Valek ( Thomas Ian    Griffith ) , a freaky Marilyn Manson-type who \'s  on a mission that dates back    600 years .^\n\nAlong the way they pick up a priest named Guiteau ( Tim Guinee ) , a    character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery Cpl .^\n\nUpham    in _Saving Private Ryan_ .^\n\nSome stuff happens in the middle of the movie , but    I ca n\'t  remember most of it , because I often found a twitching hair in the    corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen.     _Vampires_ finally starts to pick up aboutminutes into the mix , as Crow ,    Guiteau , and Montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire nest .^\n\nOnly    then does the film begin to even resemble a Carpenter flick .^\n\nBut it \'s  too    little too late .^\n\nWe get the inevitable final confrontation , but it seems    tacked on and rather anti-climactic ( Come on , we \'re  dealing with _the_    master vampire here ! )    ^\n\nInterestingly , last summer \'s  vampire actioner _Blade_ was derived from a    comic book , and _Vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seems more steeped    in campy cheesiness than the former , a more deliberate superhero flick .   ^\n\nWoods \' Jack Crow spouts glib off-the-cuff one-liners and strolls away from    exploding buildings with that oh-so-cool stride .^\n\nAnd his motive for killing    vampires ?^\n\nTake a wild guess .^\n\n( Hint : A ______ killed his _____ when he was    just a _____ . )    ^\n\nAt least _Blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness. _Vampires_ lacks    even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot .^\n\nTo make up for this , the    movie  resorts  to other \" shocks , \" such as its generally condescending    attitude towards women ( Crow slaps them around for the fun of it ) and an    overplayed contempt for religion ( Crow teases Guiteau incessantly about    whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to \" getting woodies . \" )    ^\n\nIt can be argued that maybe I wanted too much from this movie .^\n\nIf not scary    and gory , I wanted tense , relentless , and exhausting. _John Carpenter \'s     Vampires_ is none of these .^\n\nI can only recommended it for the hardcore    Carpenter  fan . ^\n\nFor the rest of you looking for a good scare , beware :    _Vampires_ is a film with no teeth .

cv946_20084.txt,'Summer movies are  , by nature  , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money .  ^\n\nWild Wild West  , the latest Will Smith affair  , follows much the same formula  , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies .  ^\n\nWill Smith plays Jim West  , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses .  ^\n\nHe is called by President Grant ( Kline  ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing .  ^\n\nWest is paired up with scientist Artemus Gordon ( Kline again  ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind  , named Dr.Loveless ( Branagh  , with a zany moustache .  )  ^\n\nBefore I pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair  , I \'ll   give it a chance with the positives .  ^\n\nThere \'s   a nice credit sequence  , the production design by Bo Welch is pleasing to the eye  , and the special effects are decent enough .  ^\n\nThere \'s   also a pleasant soundtrack .  ^\n\nBuried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes .  ^\n\nAnd Salma Hayek pops up as the female interest  , which is always nice to see .  ^\n\nApart from these factors  , though  , nothing else in Wild Wild West works .  ^\n\nFirstly  , there \'s   little chemistry between Smith and Kline  , who appears to be in it purely for the money .  ^\n\nOne would expect zingers passing between the two  : none arise .  ^\n\nBoth of them plod through the below standard plot  , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end .  ^\n\nNot even Kenneth Branagh provides much entertainment  : although he is over the top  , the material does n\'t   present much opportunity for Branagh to be truly crazy .  ^\n\nTherefore  , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious .  ^\n\nThe only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy Salma Hayek  , who is given so little screen time it \'s   embarrassing .  ^\n\nShe appears to be in the film to merely show off her body  , and be ogled at by Kline and Smith .  ^\n\nHer character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script  , and there is no sense of realism about the character .  ^\n\nThe \' humour \' in the film is also very off .  ^\n\nWill Smith put a little spin to his daft lines in Men In Black  , here  , not even Smith could save the humour on display .  ^\n\nThe script largely boils down to insults that are n\'t   very funny  , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk .  ^\n\nIt \'s   also somewhat racist  , although it does n\'t   intend to be  , with one scene with Jim West trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching  , and actually says slavery is good to save himself .  ^\n\nIt \'s   not a funny scene  , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably .  ^\n\nThe film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case Kline  ) in a dress is automatically unfunny  , it is n\'t    , but the Wild Wild West makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness .  ^\n\nThere \'s   also problems with the plot .  ^\n\nJim West and Artemus Gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations  , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying  , and rely purely on luck  , rather than audience pleasing skill .  ^\n\nPlot elements are introduced into the film  , and then thrown away just as quickly .  ^\n\nThe main piece of the story  , a 80 foot mechanical  , steam driven spider devised by Loveless looks rather impressive  , but there \'s   no particular reason why it should be built .  ^\n\nWhy not Loveless build a great big tank  , instead of an ungainly  , fragile piece of machinery that \'s   just begging to be blown up  ?  ^\n\nDirector Barry Sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them  , with some nice camera tricks  , but even this is missing from this stilted affair .  ^\n\nWild Wild West could have benefited from Sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing  , but not much of it is evident  , making this film drag out even more .  ^\n\nIt \'s   a sad thing when _four_ ( credited  ) screenwriters  , a talented director and a willing star ca n\'t   make a film work  , and eventually Wild Wild West collapses under it \'s   sexist  , mildly racist  , unfunny weight .

cv949_21565.txt,'` Bats  \' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan .  ^\n\nTo pull something like this off  , you need to have a sense of wit and style  , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines .  ^\n\nSomething like the underground worm thriller ` Tremors  \' had just the perfect mixture of these elements  , and in return  , the film was tremendous fun .  ^\n\nWith the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player  , ` Bats  \' mainly plays it \'s   premise for straight-arrow horror .  ^\n\nJudging by the ridiculous premise  , this was not exactly a wise move .  ^\n\nThe movie attempts to capture the essence of Alfred Hitchcock \'s   ` The Birds  \'  , but fails miserably .  ^\n\nDone right  , it could have been adequately amusing Halloween cinema .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , ` Bats  \' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly  , terribly wrong .  ^\n\nThe only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be .  ^\n\nI will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom ` Bats  \' is aimed toward .  ^\n\nThose guys in Hollywood have made a movie about bats .  ^\n\nThese bats are not very nice  , because they eat a lot of people .  ^\n\nBoy  , are these bats ugly .  ^\n\nThey are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart .  ^\n\nThey \'ve   got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all .  ^\n\nA whole bunch of people in Texas get killed  , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats .  ^\n\nThey have big guns and other cool things to fight them with  , but the bats are pretty smart  , so it \'s   sorta hard to do .  ^\n\nThe bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good .  ^\n\nBut no  , ` Bats  \' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers .  ^\n\nThe film  , directed by Louis Morneau  , should have ventured straight into video stores .  ^\n\nOn the small screen  , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations .  ^\n\nBut sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward  ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure  , the film is poorly written  , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude .  ^\n\nEven the bats themselves are cheesy  , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed .  ^\n\nThe sheriff in the story is Emmett Kimsey ( Lou Diamond Phillips  )  , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar  , struts contentedly in his boots  , etc   ...  ) .  ^\n\nThe scientist is Dr. Sheila Casper ( Dina Meyer  )  , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as ` the best in her field \' .  ^\n\nMeyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable  , but everything about Dr. Casper is recycled beyond recognition .  ^\n\nHer memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like Oceanographic student Matt Hooper \'s   tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in ` Jaws  \' .  ^\n\nEverything revolving around ` Bats  \' is tired drivel  , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up .  ^\n\nThe supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw  , with voices dubbed in later .  ^\n\nIn fact  , that may have worked out better in the end .  ^\n\nTake one glance at Casper \'s   bat-loathing sidekick Jimmy ( Leon  )  , and you \'ll   have immediate deja vu - he \'s   the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie  , constructed specifically for timed comic relief .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , none of his comic interludes are funny .  ^\n\nIn the role of deranged mad scientist Dr. McCabe  , the reliable Bob Gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch .  ^\n\nMcCabe ` accidentally \' released two experimental test subjects  , and the virus spread to other bats .  ^\n\nThe entire town of Gallup  , Texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures  , but Gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else .  ^\n\nSomething like  : ` When is the damn movie going to be over  ?  ?  ^\n\nI just want my money . \'  ^\n\nThe bats are ugly  , I must say .  ^\n\nThere \'s   the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing  , but mainly  , the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery .  ^\n\nOnly bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been  , but by the absurdly stupid climax  , it \'s   way too late in the game for a decent recovery .  ^\n\nCharacters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire .  ^\n\nLet \'s   explore the logic there  : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population  ?  ?  ^\n\nYou could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one  , and after that there are only 18  , 000 more of them .  ^\n\nThis kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind ` Bats  \' .

cv950_13478.txt,'The most interesting part of  \" Ca n\'t   Hardly Wait  \" just happens to be not only the most human  , but for many of us  , the one part that many of us can easily relate to .   ^\n\nThat is the character of Denise ( Lauren Ambrose  )  , the film \'s   sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film  , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored .   ^\n\nThe film wisely holds over this moment  , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party  ... almost too nicely .   ^\n\nFor some members of the audience ( read  : me  )  , this is basically a mirror of what \'s   going on with them watching this film .   ^\n\nWe sit there wondering why we \'ve   even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place .  ^\n\nI would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this .   ^\n\nAfter all  , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which I went to high school with .   ^\n\nEveryone \'s   here  : the Jock  , the Homecoming Queen  , the Nerd ( and his dominions of Trekkies and X-Philes  )  , the Alienated Wannabe Writer  , the School Spirit Girl  , the Pothead(s  )  , the Wigger  , etc  , etc  , etc  , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial  , lame  , and basically as a bunch of losers .   ^\n\nExcept for Denise  , who rolls her eyes at everything  , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry  , something which is done for each main character  , quotes Oscar Wilde - definite pointers there  ) .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film .   ^\n\nThe film  , as I said  , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything .   ^\n\nHowever  , instead of sticking with this  , perhaps even going a bit further with it  , they let this lie  , and actually make these characters into our heroes .   ^\n\nWe follow several of them  , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism  , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them .   ^\n\nAnd if we did  , we certainly do n\'t   want to revisit that state of being .  ^\n\nHere \'s   a quick low-down  : it \'s   graduation  , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night  , otherwise known as the  \" American Grafitti  \" or  , to a lesser extent  , the  \" Dazed and Confused  \" cliche .   ^\n\nThe formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly  ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party .   ^\n\n\" Ca n\'t   Hardly Wait  \" just opts for a big indoor keg party  , and a little bit of aimless driving  , albeit of the I\'m-whining-because-I-can\'t-get-a-girl-I-want brand .   ^\n\nWe follow many people around  , but mostly we trail Preston ( Ethan Embry  , of  \" That Thing You Do  !  \"  )  , the Alienated Writer  , who \'s   been pining over the Homcoming Queen  , Amanda ( the totally overrated Jennifer Love Hewitt  )  , for the entirety of High School because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking Pop Tart .   ^\n\nNow that she \'s   broken up with her football player boyfriend  , Mike ( Peter Facinelli  )  , he decides to go to the party with a note he \'s   written declaring his  \" love  \" for her in the hopes he \'ll   build up the guts to give it to her  ... even though he \'s   leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than Kurt Vonnegut ( okay  : the ingenius Vonnegut or some icky Noxema spokesperson  ?  ) .  ^\n\nSince that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it would n\'t   be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film  , and because it \'s   a party  , there are some more main characters  , such as  : William ( Charlie Korsmo  , finally surfacing after  \" Dick Tracy  \"  )  , the Nerd ( and his dominions  ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage Mike  , who \'s   humiliated him for years  , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it  ; Kenny ( Seth Green  )  , the Wigger  , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh  )  ; and Denise  , the only exceptional character  , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( do n\'t   ask  ) with Kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point A to point B with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile .   ^\n\nUgh .  ^\n\nThe main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not  \" American Grafitti  \" or  \" Dazed and Confused  ,  \" two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining  )  , but to John Hughes films of the 80s  , most notably  \" Sixteen Candles .  \"   ^\n\nThe big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters  , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion .   ^\n\nThis film forgets to satirize its characters  , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes  ... and then says that it \'s   all okay .   ^\n\nWe ca n\'t   take this film seriously  , nor can we take this as fun  , so really what good is it  ?  ^\n\nBut I will tell you some things I did like  : I liked the direction  , except for a couple too-over-the-top features  , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it \'s   like an oxymoron  ) and other obscurities .   ^\n\nGenerally  , though  , Elfont and Kaplan do have graceful camera movement  , and even manage to capture an Altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note  , though  , is too hokey to really be admirable  ) .   ^\n\nI actually did like Seth Green  , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young Woody Allen in  \" Radio Days  \"  ) - his desintegration of his Wigger character was almost believable  ... almost .   ^\n\nAnd  , of course  , Lauren Ambrose is wonderful as Denise  , the one character we could have used some more of  , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film .  ^\n\nHowever  , the character of Denise really does n\'t   work with the film  , when really thought about .   ^\n\nShe \'s   far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half  ) to belong in this film  , and whenever she appears  , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone .   ^\n\nShe \'s   not just The Cynic or The Intellectual  ; she \'s   just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters .   ^\n\nShe may ruin the film more  , but at least when she \'s   on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves  \" Well  , at least we \'ll   be entertained .  \"  ^\n\nA couple other things that just do n\'t   work  : Mike \'s   character  , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything  : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general  ; the aimless  , bitchy driving by Preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with Amanda - give me a break  ; and perhaps the one thing that just does n\'t   work at all  : Jenna Eflman \'s   uncredited cameo as an angel - just did n\'t   work  , but nice try .  ^\n\nBasically the worst thing about this film  , the real reason I \'m   giving this such a low rating  , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we \'d   do .   ^\n\nWe do n\'t   feel for these characters because for most of us  , we are n\'t   stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots .   ^\n\nThe acid test for high school movies is  : does it at all capture the feel of what it \'s   portraying  ?   ^\n\nThe answer for this film is no.  Nice try  , though .   '
cv951_11816.txt,'The film may be called MERCURY RISING  , but that title does n\'t    describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture  , a routine thriller  that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated  buddy story .   ^\n\nThe  \" hook  \" that is supposed to make MERCURY RISING unique  is that the young protagonist is autistic .   ^\n\nHowever  , aside from giving  actor Miko Hughes a chance to win raves for his performance  , this  particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a  convenient plot device .   ^\n\nThose expecting to see even a semi-thorough  exploration of the condition will be disappointed .   ^\n\nMERCURY RISING  treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action  thrillers accord to alcoholism .       ^\n\nThe script for MERCURY RISING is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow .   ^\n\nI do n\'t   know whether the problem is in the original book  ,  SIMPLE SIMON  , or in the screenplay adaptation  , but this movie easily  exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief  is no longer possible .   ^\n\nOnce again  , certain standby plot elements --   the  high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent  --   are recycled  , and not to good effect .   ^\n\nWhile Bruce Willis can play  the action hero as well as anyone in Hollywood  , this particular outing  leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little  tension and too much nonsense .       ^\n\nThe story begins with a formulaic sequence in which The Tough FBI  Agent with a Heart of Gold  , Art Jeffries ( Bruce Willis  )  , is confronted  with his own failure .   ^\n\nUnable to resolve a hostage crisis in time  , he is  forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death .   ^\n\nThe event weighs  heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation  for protecting 9-year old Simon Lynch ( Miko Hughes  ) when he discovers  the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned  down by The Evil Hit Man Who Looks Like an Ex-Football Player .   ^\n\nSoon  ,  Art and Simon are on the run from seemingly everyone --   fleeing for  their lives and bonding at the same time  , with The Evil Hit Man Who  Looks Like an Ex-Football Player always just a step behind them .   ^\n\nAlong  the way  , they are helped by The Best Friend Who Defies Orders to Help  Out His Buddy ( Chi McBride  ) and the Supporting Female Who May or May Not  Become a Love Interest ( Kim Dickens  ) .         ^\n\nWhy is Simon in danger and why were his parents turned into Swiss  cheese by The Evil Hit Man Who Looks Like an Ex-Football Player  ?    ^\n\nApparently  , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an  ultra-secret code called  \" Mercury .  \"   ^\n\nTo make sure it ca n\'t   be cracked  ,  they do the most intuitive thing possible  :  place a sample of it in a   \" nerds  \' puzzle magazine .  \"   ^\n\nOf course  , no one can solve it --   no one  except autistic Simon  , that is .   ^\n\nWhen he calls the phone number listed  in the solution  , he gets the NSA .   ^\n\nAs a result  , The Cold-Hearted  ,  Sneering Government Man ( Alec Baldwin  ) decides that Simon has to be  eliminated --   for the good of the country  , of course .   ^\n\nBut he has n\'t    counted on The Tough FBI Agent with a Heart of Gold  , even though  everyone in the audience has .       ^\n\nIt \'s   hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that does n\'t   do  anything exceptionally well  , and does quite a few things rather poorly .    ^\n\nFor those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like  ,  MERCURY RISING manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time  , but  even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where Art and Simon are  crouched down  , avoiding passing trains  ) are n\'t   that pulse-pounding .   ^\n\nThe  climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that  is painful in its obviousness .   ^\n\nOverall  , director Harold Becker is  constantly struggling ( and failing  ) to generate even a moment that is n\'t    derivative or obligatory .       ^\n\nBruce Willis  \' star seems to be fading .   ^\n\nThis is his fourth straight  lackluster outing  , following LAST MAN STANDING  , THE FIFTH ELEMENT  , and  THE JACKAL .   ^\n\nWillis is n\'t   terrible  , but this is the kind of role he can  sleepwalk through  , and often does .   ^\n\nAlec Baldwin  , combining elements of  his characters from GLENGARRY GLENN ROSS and MALICE  , does some scenery- chewing  , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace .   ^\n\nThe  film \'s   real star is young Miko Hughes ( Heather Langenkamp \'s   son in WES  CRAVEN \'S   NEW NIGHTMARE  )  , who does as good a job as Dustin Hoffman  playing an autistic individual  , but is about 50 years younger .         ^\n\nMERCURY RISING joins the likes of HARD RAIN  , THE REPLACEMENT  KILLERS  , and U.S. MARSHALS on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers .   ^\n\nFor  those who like action and adventure in the theater  , this has not been a  good year .   ^\n\nHopefully  , the advent of summer will change that .   ^\n\nUntil  then  , the best choices ( for Bruce Willis or any other action hero  ) are  on video .   ^\n\nAnd  , if you \'re   determined to see Mercury rising  , check out  the morning sky in early May .

cv954_19932.txt,'A new entry in the \"revisionist history\" genre of filmmaking, Dick suggests    that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the    nation\'s biggest presidential scandal.^\n\nKirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams    star  Betsy  and Arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from    Arlene \'s  Watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across G. Gordon Liddy    ( played dead-on by Harry Shearer ) and the infamous break-in .^\n\nWhen they    recognize Liddy later on during a White House field trip , they are ushered    into  a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as    official presidential dog walkers .^\n\nThe girls manage to unwittingly uncover    every bit of the Watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have    no clue as to what they are getting involved with .^\n\nWhen they discover that    Nixon ( another dead-on performance by Dan Hedaya , who actually favors Nixon    slightly ,  unlike  Anthony  Hopkins ) has been abusive to Checkers , the    presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they    quit and become disillusioned .^\n\nDuring a prank phone call the girls make to    Woodward and Bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to    the president \'s  resignation .    ^\n\nThis film starts off promisingly with an aged Woodward and Bernstein arguing    with each other on an obvious Larry King-type talk show ( featuring a cameo    by French Stewart ) about revealing the identity of \" Deep Throat \" .^\n\nFrom    there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad    \" dick \" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy .^\n\nAt one point ,    the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps    of the Lincoln Memorial .^\n\nThe band manages to stop right as Dunst screams    \" You  have  to stop letting Dick run your life ! \" much to the horror of    everyone standing within earshot .^\n\nSeveral other variations on this wordplay    surface all throughout the film .^\n\nIf this movie had been smarter I would have    been less likely to fault it \'s  juvenile bathroom humor , but it \'s  not .^\n\nThe    film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major    player in the Watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience \'s     throat in the least subtle way possible .^\n\nI do n\'t  recall Oliver Stone \'s  Nixon    having to pander to it \'s  audience , but of course that film was n\'t  a comedy    aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience .    ^\n\nThe only redeeming thing about this movie is it \'s  remarkable supporting    cast . ^\n\nI  wanted  to  see more of Ferrell and McCulloch \'s  Woodward and    Bernstein .^\n\nThose two characters are the sole basis for my rating .^\n\nI wish    they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only    relegated to the final half-hour .^\n\nTheir constant bickering and fighting over    trying  to get the story are a major highlight , especially McCulloch \'s     constant thwarting of Ferrell \'s  attempts to gather information from the    girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as Deep Throat , so    named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by Betsy \'s  brother ) .    ^\n\nThe other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their    particular characters , but are given nothing to work with .^\n\nI \'d  like to see    the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their    comedic abilities .^\n\nAs for the two leads , Dunst and Williams can definitely    do  better . ^\n\nThey come off as what could best be described as Romy and    Michele:The  Early  Years  in  this  particular film , a highly dubious    distinction at best .^\n\nStay through the first half of the end credits though ,    to  see an interesting scene involving Dunst and Williams suggestively    sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie .    ^\n\nAn excellent idea marred by poor execution , Dick could have been a great    movie .^\n\nLess of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed    by the Woodward and Bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful    satire of the Nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen    year olds .^\n\nAs it stands though , Dick offers nothing but what filmmaker Kevin    Smith so accurately defines as \" dick and poopie \" jokes .^\n\nAnd that , to me ,    does not make a funny movie .^\n'

cv956_12547.txt,'GODZILLA is the ultimate culmination of the  \" who cares about plot  \"  summer movie .   ^\n\nA loose remake of the 1954  \" classic  \" Japanese monster  movie  , GODZILLA  , KING OF THE MONSTERS ( which is itself pretty thin in  the story department  )  , Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin \'s   big-budget  lizard-stomps-Manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain  dead in mind .   ^\n\nThe script is n\'t   just  \" dumbed down  ,  \" it \'s   lobotomized .    ^\n\nGODZILLA lives and dies on special effects alone .         ^\n\nPresumably  , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys  ,  the demographic most likely to shell out $ 7 repeatedly to see the same  images of monster-instigated carnage .  ^\n\nThat \'s   not to say that females and  other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction  ; they \'re    just not as readily susceptible .   ^\n\nThis is the third straight movie in a  row where Emmerich and Devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of  computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than  the ability to write and direct for actors .   ^\n\nSTARGATE was a financial  success .   ^\n\nINDEPENDENCE DAY was a runaway hit .   ^\n\nAnd  , with GODZILLA  already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens  ,  it \'s   virtually guaranteed at least $ 100 million .   ^\n\nNice numbers for a  film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school  kid .         ^\n\nGODZILLA is n\'t   completely without merit  , although it is close .    ^\n\nThere \'s   a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard  rip his way through Manhattan  , but it wears off quickly .   ^\n\nFrankly  , while  the special effects are competent  , they \'re   not all that stunning .    ^\n\nThere \'s   nothing new here  ; it \'s   JURASSIC PARK meets ALIENS  , with a little  INDEPENDENCE DAY thrown in for bad measure .   ^\n\nMaybe it will require  George Lucas and his new STAR WARS movie to take computer-generated  visuals to the next level .   ^\n\nGODZILLA never really pushes the envelope  ,  preferring to remain within a comfort zone .   ^\n\nThe imagination of monster  movies like KING KONG has been replaced by a crass  , formulaic approach  which disallows creativity .   ^\n\n( How disturbing is it to know that GODZILLA  has been chosen to close the 51st Cannes Film Festival  ?  )       ^\n\nWorst of all  , GODZILLA is n\'t   even exciting .   ^\n\nWith the possible  exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end  , there is n\'t   a  sequence in this film that raises the pulse .   ^\n\nEven the scenes with  dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and  suspense that they are yawn-provoking .   ^\n\nINDEPENDENCE DAY may have been  dumb  , but it was full of  \" adrenaline moments  \" capable of getting the  audience involved in the action .   ^\n\nIn this aspect of its production  , as  in so many others  , GODZILLA is lacking .   ^\n\nActually  , part of the problem  is that we \'re   never sure who we \'re   supposed to be rooting for  :  the  green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop  him .       ^\n\nThe plot  , such as it is  , can be summed up rather simply .   ^\n\nAfter  sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands  ,  Godzilla shows up in the Big Apple .   ^\n\nHe does some of the usual tourist  things  :  stops by Madison Square Garden  , visits the Chrysler Building  ,  goes on a walk through Central Park  , and takes the subway .   ^\n\nIn the  process  , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs  , but  he never has trouble with traffic jams .   ^\n\nOn hand to stop him is an elite  U.S. army unit  , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man  ( Kevin Dunn  ) and a biologist named Nick Tatopoulos  , who has a theory  about Godzilla .   ^\n\nIn his opinion  , the big guy is actually a lizard grown  to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by French  atomic bomb tests in the South Pacific .   ^\n\nIn Nick \'s   words  , Godzilla is  \" a  mutated aberration An incipient creature The first of its kind .  \"   ^\n\nAs  luck would have it  , Nick \'s   old girlfriend  , Audrey ( Maria Pitillo  )  , is a  reporter based at a New York TV station .   ^\n\nAlong with her cameraman  friend  , Animal ( Hank Azaria  )  , she decides to follow Nick around as he  trails Godzilla .   ^\n\nThen  , just when the military has rejected Nick \'s    theory about why Godzilla is in New York  , a member of the French Secret  Service ( Jean Reno  ) recruits him for a special assignment .       ^\n\nInstead of stomping around Tokyo this time  , Godzilla has chosen New  York City .   ^\n\nUnfortunately  , Manhattan has been destroyed so many times in  recent disaster movies ( INDEPENDENCE DAY  , DEEP IMPACT  , ARMAGEDDON  ) that  it \'s   becoming boring .   ^\n\nThe whole tradition of monsters roaming around  the city started with KING KONG  , but the big ape was only about 30 feet  tall .   ^\n\nHe could climb the Empire State Building .   ^\n\nAt ten times that  height  , Godzilla would be more likely to knock it over .       ^\n\nGODZILLA contains a few lame attempts at humor .   ^\n\nThere \'s   an ongoing  feud between Animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material  , an  unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce Nick \'s   last  name properly  , and a rather tame attack on film critics Roger Ebert and  Gene Siskel .   ^\n\nBoth of the popular personalities have alter egos in the  film  :   \" Ebert  ,  \" the mayor of New York  , is played by Michael Lerner  , and   \" Gene  \" ( Lorry Goldman  ) is his campaign manager .   ^\n\nEbert \'s   re-election  slogan is  , not surprisingly  ,  \" Thumbs Up for New York .  \"   ^\n\nThe Siskel/Ebert  stuff is amusing the first time it \'s   used  , but  , after a while  , it grows  tiresome .   ^\n\nAnd  , although the  \" characters  \" do n\'t   serve any real purpose  ,  they keep popping up .        ^\n\nGODZILLA is saddled with an unimpressive cast .   ^\n\nThis is largely  because Emmerich does n\'t   want to risk a human performance upstaging his  lizard .   ^\n\nThat \'s   not to say that Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno are n\'t    capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting  in the past  )  , but they are n\'t   A-list names .   ^\n\nThen again  , considering the  quality of the writing  , even Pacino and DeNiro would have been hard- pressed to shine .   ^\n\nMaria Pitillo ( DEAR GOD  ) plays the love interest and  Hank Azaria ( GREAT EXPECTATIONS  ) is on hand to present what is supposed  to be comic relief .       ^\n\nUltimately  , it does n\'t   really matter what I ( or any other critic  ,  for that matter  ) have to say about the movie .   ^\n\nTriStar has assumed that  GODZILLA  , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures  , is  pretty much critic-proof .   ^\n\nIt may also be word-of-mouth-proof .   ^\n\nThose  who want to see the movie will see it no matter what I write or their  friends say .   ^\n\nSo  , when I go on record to assert that GODZILLA is one of  the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time  , it \'s   like spitting into  the wind .   ^\n\nEmmerich and Devlin are master illusionists  , waving their  wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors .   ^\n\nIt \'s    probably too much to hope that some day  , movie-goers will wake up and  realize that they \'ve   been had .

cv967_5626.txt,'The crown jewel of 1970 \'s   Irwin Allen disaster movies  ,  THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE features an all-star cast including  Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine spouting some of the most  laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a  cruise ship .  ^\n\nThe story begins on the U.S.S. Poseidon \'s   big New  Year \'s   cruise  , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people  who will soon be the only passengers left alive .          ^\n\nLet \'s   see  , there \'s   the New Age preacher ( Hackman  ) who  advises people to  \" pray to that part of God within yourself .  \"   ^\n\nThere \'s   the ex-cop ( Borgnine  ) who busted a hooker ( Stella Stevens  )  six times --   then married her .  ^\n\nThere \'s   the hippie singer (  \" There \'s   got  to be a morning after   ...  \"  ) who turns to the company of a lonely man  ( Red Buttons  ) once her brother is killed .  ^\n\nAnd to round out the  group  : the elderly couple ( Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters  )  who live aboard the ship  , the beautiful teenage girl and her brother  who are sailing alone and adventurous Scotsman Roddy  McDowall .          ^\n\nWe get to know these people a little too well in the first  thirty minutes of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE  , before straight- faced ship captain Leslie Nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal  wave headed right for the ship .  ^\n\nEveryone \'s   in the giant ballroom at  the time  , shortly past midnight of the new year  , when the ship  turns first on its side  , then completely upside down .  ^\n\nThe second- in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help  arrives  , but rebel Hackman leads his small band of followers on  a quest to the top of the ship .          ^\n\nIn this case  , because the ship is overturned  , the top is the  bottom .  ^\n\nOr is the bottom the top  ?  ^\n\nEither way  , we get to see a lot of  bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both  conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera  shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and --   in the ballroom  scene --   Christmas trees .  ^\n\nThus begins an hour or more of hushed  trips down long corridors  , through burning rooms  , etc. while the  ship slowly fills with water behind them .          ^\n\nIt \'s   a race against the clock which is only mildly  interesting .  ^\n\nTHE POSEIDON ADVENTURE works more as a Bad  Movie To Laugh At  , with all the melodrama that comes in-between  the non-thrilling action scenes .  ^\n\nThe one note in Borgnine \'s   one-note  performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with Hackman  every step of the way while Buttons and the hippie fall in love  ( although since there is n\'t   a sex scene  , we never find out if his  buttons really are Red  ) and Albertson and Winters wonder if  they \'ll   live to see their grandson \'s   birth .          ^\n\nShelley Winters provides the most hilarious scene in the  movie in a scene toward the end  , where water has flooded the next  two rooms of the ship and Hackman is preparing to dive under with  a rope for the rest of them to pull along .  ^\n\nWinters  , who has been the  whiny fat woman throughout the movie ( Stevens even not-so- affectionately calls her  \" fatass  \" in one scene  )  , finally finds her  purpose .  ^\n\n\" I was the underwater swimming champ of New York  three years running when I was seventeen  ,  \" she brags  , and before  Hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three  years  , she \'s   swimming through the water  , her skirt billowing up  around her hips  , showing off her cellulite ( or do you call it  Shellulite  ?  ) ridden thighs .  ^\n\nIt \'s   not so much funny as innately  disgusting  , which pretty much sums up THE POSEIDON  ADVENTURE as a whole  .'
cv968_25413.txt,'While watching LOSER, it occurred to me that Amy Heckerling\'s true genius as    a film-maker is casting.^\n\nIn FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH , she gave us Sean    Penn \'s  Jeff Spicoli ; in LOOK WHO \'S  TALKING , she turned Bruce Willis into a    wise-cracking baby and provided John Travolta with is first career revival ;    in CLUELESS , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was )    Alicia  Silverstone .^\n\nShe seems to understand instinctively how to find    performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws .^\n\nUnfortunately ,    she  may  also  be starting to understand that she understands .^\n\nGiving    appealing  actors  an appealing script creates likeable movies .^\n\nGiving    appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for    unexpectedly awful films like LOSER .    ^\n\nNaturally , Heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy .^\n\nPaul    Tannek ( Jason Biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to NYU , then    instantly  finds  himself an island of compassion and diligence in the    cold-hearted big city .^\n\nPaul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the    subway  to an elderly woman ; his roommates Adam ( Zak Orth ) , Chris ( Tom    Sadoski ) and Noah ( Jimmi Simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music    and let their waterbeds leak all over Paul .^\n\nPaul is also the kind of guy who    adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely Dora Diamond ( Mena Suvari ) .   ^\n\nDora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her    tuition and a relationship with a professor , Edward Alcott ( Greg Kinnear ) ,    that \'s  more than slightly one-sided .^\n\nThey \'re  two conscientious kids who love    animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if Paul    is a loser .    ^\n\nI must confess that , for a while , I was suckered in by Heckerling \'s  casting .   ^\n\nJason Biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him    even  easier  to embrace ; Suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of    intelligence .^\n\nThey \'re  pleasant enough to watch , and Heckerling gives us    plenty  of  scenes  establishing  how nice they are and how nice their    respective antagonists are n\'t  .^\n\nThen it gradually becomes clear that there \'s     virtually nothing to LOSER but scenes of that sort .^\n\nIn theory , LOSER is a    romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire    film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video    store clerk ) .^\n\nInstead of taking any time to make the characters \' situations    funny , Heckerling spendsminutes making her characters \' situations pathetic .   ^\n\nShe shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked CLUELESS , nor any    of  that  film \'s   interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since    CLUELESS \'s  plot came via Jane Austen \'s  EMMA ) .^\n\nShe simply turns the film into    a pity party .    ^\n\nSince LOSER is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character ,    you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least    slightly complicated .^\n\nInstead , you have people either so perfect or so    unredeemable that there \'s  no reason to watch them .^\n\nPaul is n\'t  just a nice    guy ,  he \'s   flawless ;  consequently , he \'s  a central character who does    absolutely no growing .^\n\nHis roommates are n\'t  just inconsiderate , they \'re     actively evil-blackmailing Professor Alcott , drugging women with Rohypnol    and generally giving humanity a bad name .^\n\nAnd Professor Alcott is n\'t  just    manipulative , he turns Dora into his house slave .^\n\nDora \'s  unthinking devotion    to Alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in LOSER , and    even that is n\'t  explored in sufficient detail .^\n\nThere \'s  more ambiguity in the    30-second snippet from Alan Cumming \'s  Broadway performance as the Emcee in    CABARET then there is in the rest of LOSER It \'s  one thing to turn supporting    characters into comic exaggerations ; it \'s  another to flatten your leads into    easily digestible mush .^\n\nAnd it would help if those comic exaggerations were    somehow  ...^\n\nI do n\'t  know  ... comic .    ^\n\nStill ,  I  spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that    Heckerling would somehow salvage LOSER from its tedium and justify my desire    to like Paul and Dora .^\n\nThat hope dissolved the moment Heckerling underscored    a sequence of Paul in the throes of unrequited love to Simon and Garfunkel \'s     \" Scarborough Fair/Canticle . \"^\n\nInstead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a    reference to THE GRADUATE , a hint that Paul is becoming an overly-sensitive    clich-Heckerling plays it deadly straight .^\n\nEven in the scenes that scream    for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist \'s  foibles ,    she  finds  it  impossible  to stray from the Gospel of Paul as Saint .   ^\n\nCLUELESS \'s  Cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to    balance her cuteness .^\n\nIn LOSER , Amy Heckerling shows a leaden hand with    material that demands friskiness ( her one show of wit involves naming Paul \'s     dorm \" Hunt \'s  Hall \" after erstwhile Bowery Boy Huntz Hall ) .^\n\nHer gift with    casting proved to be her curse .^\n\nLOSER may be a crashing bore , but gee ,    are n\'t  those two kids swell ?

coming on the heals of    such a marvelously written project as \" THE CLIENT \" is such a shock that it    gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke .^\n\nSituations are    developed

and bring her back from    the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no    warmth .^\n\nThis is indeed a cold hearted man .^\n\nThe development of POISON IVY is    no less contradictory .^\n\nShe wants to breed a form of plant life that can    defend itself like an animal .^\n\nShe joins with Mr. Freeze in his plan to start    a  new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant    creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to    breed into them .^\n\nThe characters have no logic .^\n\nBatman of course is no longer    the Dark Knight of the earlier films .^\n\nNow that he has an adoptive son in    Burt Ward  / Robin , Bruce Wayne is trying to be a Father figure , constantly    spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time    not really having any .^\n\nGeorge Clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his    eyes while reciting the dialogue given him .^\n\nTo say that his performance is    workman-like is to be generous .^\n\nHis best performances are still on \" E.R. \" .   ^\n\nBruce Wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by    Elle

for her commercial value and she knew it .^\n\nThis brings us to    the villains .^\n\nArnold Scharzenegger walks through his part with all the    concern of someone waiting for payday .^\n\nThe most rediculous scene is during    Mr. Freeze \'s  imprisonment .^\n\nThe guards are at least a foot taller that Arnold    and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes    caught

cv975_11920.txt,'In the 1982 updating of Mickey Spillane \'s   1947 novel  \" I  , The Jury  ,  \" hard-boiled detective Mike Hammer is a Vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze Trans Am  , dresses like Don Johnson in  \" Miami Vice  \" with less pastels  , and has sworn off alcohol .  ^\n\nHowever  , he still smokes his Lucky Strikes  , detests all forms of authority  , and kills at a whim .  ^\n\nBeyond that  , the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page-turner by Spillane  , probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers .  ^\n\nThe movie starts off with a bang  : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the James Bond series  , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by Bill Conti (  \" Rocky  \"  ) .  ^\n\nAfter that  , the movie and the book begin the same  , with the murder of Jack Williams ( Frederick Downs  )  , a one-armed detective and Hammer \'s   best friend .  ^\n\nHammer declares that he will seek vengeance for Jack \'s   death  , and with the help of his devoted secretary  , the blond and shapely Velda ( Laurene Landon  )  , and the alternately friendly   / antagonistic police chief Pat Chambers ( Paul Sorvino  )  , he is immediately on the killer \'s   trail .  ^\n\nHere the movie splits completely from the book  , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the Mafia  , the CIA  , one of Hammer \'s   Vietnam vet buddies  , and a kinky sex clinic .  ^\n\nMany of the same characters from the book appear in the movie  , but they take on slightly different roles .  ^\n\nFor instance  , Charles Kalecki ( Alan King  )  , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book  , turns into a suave mob boss .  ^\n\nAnd  , more importantly  , Hammer \'s   suspicious love interest  , Charlotte Bennett ( Barbara Carrera  )  , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic .  ^\n\n\" I  , The Jury  \" is one of several cinematic renditions of Spillane \'s   books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-D  )  , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way  : it includes all of the sex and violence Spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to Hollywood \'s   production code .  ^\n\nAlthough this takes the 1982 version of  \" I  , The Jury  \" closer to the core of the original subject matter  , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism  , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book .  ^\n\nRest assured  , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity  , but it is thoroughly violent  , especially toward women .  ^\n\nIt features one woman having her neck slashed  , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the CIA ( Judson Scott  )  , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by Hammer himself .  ^\n\nNo one would deny that Spillane \'s   writing has a definite misogynistic nature  , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment  ; its constant equation of sex and violence  , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic  , is quite unsettling .  ^\n\nIt \'s   no surprise that the movie  , like the book  , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor .  ^\n\n\" I  , The Jury  \" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it  , which is one explanation why it did n\'t   do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made .  ^\n\nThe script was written by Larry Cohen  , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies  , like  \" It \'s   Alive  \" ( 1974  ) and its two sequels  ,  \" Q  \" ( 1981  )  , and  \" The Stuff  \" ( 1985  ) .  ^\n\nCohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well  , but he was yanked from the director \'s   chair after only a week \'s   worth of shooting because he was already $ 100,000 over budget .  ^\n\nHe was quickly replaced by Richard T. Heffron  , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects .  ^\n\nHeffron was obviously brought in not for his talent  , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently .  ^\n\nIt shows in the final product .  ^\n\nCohen had personal interest in the updated version of Hammer  , but Heffron has none .  ^\n\nHe shot the movie quickly and clumsily  , and although some scenes ring true  , most of them are flat  , trite  , and invariably dull .  ^\n\nThe movie features numerous car chases  , shoot-outs  , and stunts  , but Heffron \'s   background in television is the dominant tone  ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity  ,  \" I  , The Jury  ,  \" takes on the air of a made-for-TV quickie  , with no real punch or depth .  ^\n\nBut the problems in  \" I  , The Jury  \" run deeper than the technical .  ^\n\nThe central fault in this updating is Mike Hammer  , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties .  ^\n\nBecause Spillane wrote all his Hammer mysteries in the first person  , Hammer \'s   character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona .  ^\n\nWe never really get that impression in the movie --   there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes do n\'t   have Hammer in them at all .  ^\n\nConsequently  , a great deal of the texture of Spillane \'s   storytelling is lost .  ^\n\nThe period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of Hammer \'s   moral code is thrown to the wind .  ^\n\nDespite his characterization as a hard-nosed  , violent  , misogynistic killer  , Hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code .  ^\n\nThe title itself  ,  \" I  , The Jury  ,  \" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law .  ^\n\nUnlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police  , Hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment .  ^\n\nIn this way  , he can be seen as  \" above the law  ,  \" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct  , his own morality .  ^\n\nThe movie forgoes that aspect of his character  , and Hammer comes off not only as amoral in society \'s   terms  , but in any terms  , especially his own .  ^\n\nIf anything  , Hammer always had his professionalism  , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful .  ^\n\nMaybe the scene was intended for laughs  , but it only cheapens Hammer \'s   character and is  , by all accounts  , a lousy way to start the movie .  ^\n\nThe blame for Hammer \'s   character ca n\'t   be laid on Assante \'s   shoulders  , because despite some unnecessary Marlon Brandon-like mumbling  , he delivers a fine performance .  ^\n\nSpillane never once described Hammer \'s   physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared  , so any actor could conceivably portray him .  ^\n\nOf course  , because of the lack of written description  , those who have read Spillane \'s   books will have a strong personal notion of what Hammer looks like  , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( Spillane  , who played the character himself in 1963 \'s    \" The Girl Hunters  ,  \" is generally considered the best of the film Hammers  ) .  ^\n\nThe rest of actors are most un-noteworthy .  ^\n\nWith the exceptions of Alan King and Paul Sorvino  , everyone who appeared in  \" I  , The Jury  \" were up-and-comers who basically went nowhere .  ^\n\nMany of them ended up working in television ( like Carrera  , who had a short stint on  \" Dallas  \" in the mid-eighties  )  , which only adds to the made-for-TV atmosphere of the film .  ^\n\nMaybe someday  , someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a Spillane book  , but this is certainly not it  .'

cv980_11851.txt,'With his successful books and movies  , Michael Crichton is doing well .  ^\n\nWith early successes with Westworld ( 1973  ) and Coma ( 1978  )  , and recent films such as Jurassic Park ( 1993  )  , his films have been entertaining .  ^\n\nHowever  , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with Sphere .  ^\n\nThis $ 100 million mess by good director Barry Levison ( Disclosure  ) is dull  , long winded  , and a huge disappointment .  ^\n\nConsidering the huge budget  , the all star cast  , and a story by Crichton  , Sphere is majorly disappointing .  ^\n\nThe film opens with Norman Goodman ( Hoffman  )  , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors .  ^\n\nHowever  , when he arrives  , he his told by supervisor Barnes ( Peter Coyote  ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft .  ^\n\nAlong with Goodman is mathematician Harry Adams ( Jackson  )  , biologist Beth Halperin ( Stone  ) and Ted Fielding ( Liev Schrieber .  )  ^\n\nThey investigate the spaceship  , find a massive sphere inside  , meet an alien intelligence called Jerry  , and basically weird crap happens .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , something went wrong along the way with Sphere .  ^\n\nThe film starts off entertaining enough  , but throughout this very long movie  , it just gets sillier and sillier .  ^\n\nThe film jaunts along from scene to scene  , never fully explaining what is going on .  ^\n\nThe actors and directing do n\'t   help  , either .  ^\n\nHoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed  ) throughout the movie  , churning out dull lines  , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie .  ^\n\nStone is useless  , displaying no emotion  , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for Hoffman .  ^\n\nThe only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is Jackson  , who \'s   funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere .  ^\n\nBut he \'s   hardly in it  , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as Hoffman and Stone .  ^\n\nThe same goes for Peter Coyote  , who hams it up as the officer  , but is then killed off halfway through .  ^\n\nThe director  , Barry Levinson  , who directed the better Crichton adaptation Disclosure ( 1994  ) messes up with the drama and the action .  ^\n\nThe drama scenes are  , quite frankly  , boring  , and the action scenes suffer from overkill  , with Levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful Speed 2  , 1997  ) The writing does n\'t   help much  , either .  ^\n\nAlthough Crichton is great with plots  , he \'s   terrible with dialogue  , and practically every line in Sphere is a dud .  ^\n\nThe speech is too simple  , I was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent .   ^\n\nPractically every line is just stating the obvious .  ^\n\nNone of it is smart .  ^\n\nAlso  , where the hell did the budget go  ?  ^\n\nThe sphere itself is impressive  , and there \'s   a few nice special effect shots  , but where the $ 100 million went is anyone \'s   guess .  ^\n\nThere \'s   a giant squid attack in the picture  , but not once does the audience see the squid  , even though the film has a massive budget .  ^\n\nI assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid  , and if handled correctly it probably would .  ^\n\nBut the whole scene is done badly  , and I was just hoping we could see the stupid squid .  ^\n\nFinally  , the film has no idea what genre to be .  ^\n\nLevison ca n\'t   handle his own plot .  ^\n\nIt leaps from hokey sci-fi  , to horror  , and finally The Shining/Event Horizon psychological thriller .  ^\n\nAnd  , of course  , the film is very much like The Abyss ( 1988  )  , although in it \'s   defense  , Crichton did write Sphere before The Abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish .  )  ^\n\nIt \'s   not all that bad though .  ^\n\nThe plot is all right  , there \'s   a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary  ) and there \'s   the occasionally interesting bit .  ^\n\nBut overall  , Sphere is a big waste of some fine talent  , a lot of money  , and a potentially good movie .  ^\n\nNot really worth seeing .

 ^\n\nMost likely you do  ,  and I would n\'t   call it giving away anything to say that by the picture \'s    end  , the movie has fallen into deep  , artificial melodrama that I did n\'t    buy for a second .  ^\n\nIf there are any positive things to say about  \" Message in a Bottle  ,  \" it  is that the performances by Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman  , as  Garrett \'s   stubborn  , but loving father  , are far above par to be in such a  wasteful  ,  \" Shaggy Dog  \" love story  , and that the cinematography by Caleb  Deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast  , and  paints Chicago as an equally alluring city .  ^\n\nMeanwhile  , Costner has yet  to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has  made recently .  ^\n\nIt seems that with such bad luck  , he would n\'t   want to  make another movie set near water  , but here he is again with one of the  main  , and most ridiculous  , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea .  ^\n\nThe  other actors are all  , sadly  , wasted  , including Illeana Douglas  , an  underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the  \" friend  \" roles  ,  here playing Penn \'s   confidante and co-worker at the Tribune .  ^\n\nThe first half of  \" Message in a Bottle  \" plays like a hum-drum  , trite  television movie for the Lifetime channel  , as Theresa spends a great  deal of time  \" getting to know  \" Garrett  , with dialogue that is not the  least bit stimulating or entertaining .  ^\n\nUsually  , I am the type of person  to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is  no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships  , but  here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt   \" written  ,  \" and not as if people were really  \" talking .  \"  ^\n\nWhen the main  characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other  ,  and are not particularly interesting themselves  , you know immediately  that you are in trouble .   ^\n\nI swear that while watching  \" Message in a Bottle  ,  \" I felt as if I had  just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater  ( heck  , in actuality I \'m   not even familiar to the novel this is based on  ,  by Nicholas Sparks  ) .  ^\n\nAlways one step ahead of the characters  , the movie  ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true  Hollywood melodrama  , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger  of tearing .  ^\n\nNobody wins prizes for guessing that Garrett will eventually  find out Theresa \'s   secret  , and that several obstacles will come within  their ways of living happily ever after .  ^\n\nThis same exact problem  occurred in last year \'s   very  , very similar ( watch this  , and you will  realize just how similar I mean  ) Meg Ryan-Nicolas Cage romantic drama  ,   \" City of Angels .  \"  ^\n\nAlthough Theresa is deeply touched by the  \" heartfelt  \" letter that she  finds in the bottle  , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off  finding a message in a bottle of their own  , preferably before filming  began .  ^\n\nIt should have read  ,  \" Memo to screenwriters  : Use you brain  ! \" '

Hong ) , and his love for a servant , Tuptim ( Armi Arabe ) , and how he conflicts    with his feelings , and the ancient laws of Saim .    ^\n\nNot  even  the lone strong character of Anna can save the unbelievably    horrible waste of talent , as The King and I \'s  problems could fill the blank    pages of a journal .^\n\nI will only note the major difficulties , for it would    take pages to elaborate on every detail .^\n\nThe screenplay , written by Arthur    Rankin , Peter Bakalian , Jacqeline Feather , and David Seidler , which is based    upon the play written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein , has some of    the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory , as every time the    obnoxious king would shout , \" Etc , etc , etc , \" I would cringe .^\n\nLiterally .   ^\n\nSpeaking of cringing- I did quite a bit of this during the rather short    film ,  which  is a classic display of terrible filmmaking .^\n\nBesides the    repetitive dialogue from the King , on the whole , the songs seem out of    place , and unlike the lyrics , are unmagical .^\n\nThe sole song which is used    cleverly is \" Getting to Know You , \" which is used as Anna shows the children    the great outdoors , which they have never been exposed to .^\n\nUnlike Disney    animated features , the King and I \'s  songs do n\'t  add to the film , and are as    uneffective as could be .^\n\nTake the following scenario as an example , as the    sheer horror of the King and I \'s  music is at its worst .    ^\n\nMartin Vidnovic voices the King without effort or emotion- You hear the    saying two negatives do n\'t  make a positive ?^\n\nBelieve it !^\n\nWith the terrible    dialogue that the King has , along with his awful voice track , the King is    completely unbelievable , only shows mild signs of any personality , and the    only thing that changes in the King is that he says \" Etc. , etc. , etc. , \" more    and more as the film progresses .^\n\nNo personality at the beginning of the    movie , none at the end .^\n\nAnd where does this character \'s  personality change ?   ^\n\nHey , I thought Anna was supposed to change him !^\n\nIs n\'t  that the whole plot ?    ^\n\nThe Prime Minister \'s  hideous sidekick ( Darrell Hammond ) brings his share of    cringes as well - Oh no !^\n\nAnother one of his teeth fell out !^\n\nHARDY-HAR-HAR !   ^\n\nHe is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets , but even at age five I would    have cringed while watching him .    ^\n\nBy the way this review is going , you may think the reasoning for my hate for    this film is due to not liking animated films- Hence why I hate this movie ,    because The King and I is a disgrace to animation .^\n\nAnimated films , such as    1994\'s  The Lion King and 1998\'s  The Prince of Egypt , are among my favorite    movies of all time .^\n\nThe animation team does design their share of well    animated  settings , so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the    annoying King , until I realize that day and night switch back in fourth    within seconds .    ^\n\nI have not read the play , or seen the Oscar winning , 1956 film adaption , but    from  what  I can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version completely    butchers the play , for The King and I is never magical , nor interesting .^\n\nIf    it was n\'t  for Miranda Richardson , who voices Anna with feeling , The King and    I could earn the title , \" Worst movie of the decade . \"^\n\nInstead , The King and I    will just go down as among the year \'s  worst .    ^\n\nThe Bottom Line- Avoid this movie at all costs .^\n\nNot even young children , the    target audience in this film , will enjoy it .^\n\nNot the slightest bit .

Auel .^\n\nDirected by    Michael Chapman .^\n\nStarring Daryl Hannah , Pamela Reed , James Remar .^\n\nRated R    ( contains nudity and violence ) mins .    ^\n\nSynopsis : Cro-Magnon Ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes    certain death by a lion .^\n\nReluctantly rescued by a Neanderthal clan who likes    to  have  sex  doggy-style ,  Ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist    supermodel who challenges the Neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and    giving birth without a mate .    ^\n\nComments : Allow me to state for the record that I find Daryl Hannah an    appealing presence in movies .^\n\nShe proved quite charming as the intelligent    astronomer in the romantic comedy ROXANNE and equally creepy as Pris in the    sci-fi classic BLADE RUNNER .^\n\nTHE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR clearly tries to    capitalize on Hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking    closeup of Hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her    name in lettering the same size as the title .^\n\nNot even her starring role in    this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise    in cheese .^\n\nIt \'s  so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that    actually  tries ,  and  miserably fails , to be serious ) that it \'s  oddly    fascinating . ^\n\nThe ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience    somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out .    ^\n\nTHE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR is based upon a popular novel by Jean M. Auel .^\n\nTo    this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following .^\n\nI remember a dear    friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child    with  all  the  so-called  dirty  parts blacked out with marker by her    grandmother .^\n\nI have never read this book , but I sure hope it \'s  10,000 times    better than its film adaptation .^\n\nIf not , then I \'m  at a complete loss to    explain its popularity .    ^\n\nTHE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR immediately opens with a comically absurd scene .^\n\nA    young Ayla , looking much like Drew Barrymore in E.T. , tramps about in the    woods . ^\n\nWith  her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the    audience \'s   expectations  of  a convincing portrayal of prehistory are    immediately shattered .^\n\nWhat follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in    which an earthquake swallows up Ayla \'s  mother ( a blonde with fur pants ... er ,    leggings ) .^\n\nTearful Ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera ... well ,    as the earthquake slowly recedes .^\n\nA hungry lion becomes interested in her    for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the    wild and find a safe haven .^\n\nI wo n\'t  detail the story any further ; this seems    enough to illustrate my point .^\n\nThis movie is really stupid .^\n\nIt never even    gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief .^\n\nAlso , the obvious    comparison between the appearance of Cro-Magnon man in prehistory and the    rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a Wonderbra in    front of Charlton Heston .^\n\nThe movie does n\'t  just suggest this message ; it    whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four .^\n\nA blond , gorgeous    woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs .   ^\n\nShe \'s  of the \" new people \" ; they \'re  of the \" old people \" with \" the memories . \"   ^\n\nYep .^\n\nWe get it .^\n\nWe get it .    ^\n\nTHE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR apparently received an Academy Award nomination    for  best make-up , which surprises me .^\n\nThe movie depends upon a lot of    make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing .^\n\nAs stated before , Daryl    Hannah is Daryl Hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the    shower all the time .^\n\nThe rest of the characters have dark make-up of some    sort  smeared  over  them  to look like dirt .^\n\nThe face-painting that \'s     occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind .    ^\n\nThis movie also suffers from its new age trappings .^\n\nMaybe the music sounded    a  lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and    cliched ,  like poorly conceived elevator music .^\n\nAdd to this the film \'s     faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator    who sounds like a psychic you \'d  expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you    get a movie that has serious problems being serious .    ^\n\nTHE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR is rated R , though it \'s  probably one of the most    inoffensive offensive films I \'ve  seen in quite a while .^\n\nIt contains several    scenes of sex sans nudity .^\n\nThe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes .   ^\n\nThe funniest moment of the movie occurs when a Neanderthal in love with Ayla    attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear .^\n\nThe bear bites his head off    and the audience sees it rolling about .^\n\nAlthough this may sound gratuitous ,    I \'m  sure , it \'s  so cheesy that it probably wo n\'t  bother most people .    ^\n\nTHE  CLAN  OF THE CAVE BEAR is a bad movie .^\n\nHowever , as I wrote at the    beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality .   ^\n\nTypically when I think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man ,    fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as    man ) and Raquel Welch come to mind .^\n\nTHE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR tries so hard    to be serious that , though it \'s  so bad , the audience is still interested by    the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why I awarded this    turkey  two  stars ) . ^\n\nI  have  to think that fans of the book would be    disappointed  with  this  film  version ; however , I \'m  only basing this    observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the    movie .^\n\nI shudder to think that it could be otherwise  ...

cv993_29565.txt,'Salaries of Hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and    many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets.^\n\nActors    who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are    quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made    without their participation .^\n\nProof for that can be found even in the realm    of low-budget movies , and one fine example is BREAKAWAY , 1995 thriller    directed by Sean Dash and starring ( in)famous figure skater Tonya Harding .    ^\n\nFace of Tonya Harding is most prominently featured on movie \'s  poster , but    the main star of the film is Terri Thompson who plays Myra , attractive woman    who works as a courier for gangster .^\n\nOne day she decides to retire , but her    employers are anything but enthusiastic about that .^\n\nRealising that her life    suddenly became worthless , Myra starts running for her life , followed by    professional assassins .    ^\n\nTerri Thompson being the actual star of the film instead of Tonya Harding    becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure    skater .^\n\nAlthough Tonya Harding displays convincing martial arts abilities ,    her acting leaves much to be desired .^\n\nOn the other hand , her disappointing    efforts  are  hardly  out of place in the film that lacks originality ,    believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that    gave B-films a bad name .^\n\nMartin Sheen \'s  brother Joe Estevez , whose character    looks like he had entered from another movies \' set , is the only bright spot    of BREAKAWAY .^\n\nUnfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to    prevent viewers from realising why Tonya Harding \'s  silver screen debut    proved to be her last film .    ^\n\n'
cv994_13229.txt,'Movies like Six Days  , Seven Nights make me mad because talented people like Harrison Ford  , Anne Heche  , and Ivan Reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents.  ^\n\nThe script was written by Michael Browning  , and he decided that  , instead of thinking up new ideas  , he \'d   rehash a lot of cliches  , omit even the slightest bit of character development  , and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions .^\n\nThere are good scripts out there that high-profile actors can make ( see The Truman Show  , for instance ).  ^\n\nSix Days  , Seven Nights is simply a waste .  ^\n\nLet \'s   see . . . we have to get Harrison Ford and Anne Heche alone on an island.  ^\n\nSo  , how do we do that ?^\n\nWell  , we \'ll   make her a feisty magazine editor  , and we \'ll   make him a crusty old pilot.  ^\n\nBut wait  , she has to have a fiance  ; that can be David Schwimmer .  ^\n\nBut wait  , if she has a fiance  , how will she and Harrison Ford crash on the island alone ?  ^\n\nI know  !  ^\n\nThey \'ll   get to their vacation spot  , and then she \'ll   get called back  !  ^\n\nYessssss  !  ^\n\nSo  , they \'ll   crash on the island  , and that will be funny for about five minutes .^\n\nShucks .  ^\n\nOh  , I \'ve   got it  !

cv995_23113.txt,'If anything  ,  \" Stigmata  \" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another .  ^\n\nOf the four supernatural horror flicks released this year  , it is clearly the worst .  ^\n\nI suppose I should have seen this coming .  ^\n\nAfter all  ,  \" Blair Witch  \" thoroughly creeped me out  ,  \" Sixth Sense  \" was mildly spooky  , and then  \" Stir of Echoes  \" had its moments  , but was n\'t   anything I \'d   lose sleep over .  ^\n\nClearly  , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping .  ^\n\nIs it then any surprise that  \" Stigmata  \" is the dullest  , most horribly executed piece of MTV-influenced tripe I have seen in a long while  ?  ^\n\nNo  , not really .  ^\n\nPatricia Arquette plays Frankie Page  , a hairdresser from Pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother .  ^\n\nAs it turns out  , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased Brazilian priest .  ^\n\nThe priest \'s   church had been under investigation by Father Andrew Kiernan ( Gabriel Byrne  ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue .  ^\n\nFather Kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs  , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue .  ^\n\nHis investigation is soon called off  , however  , when the Frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata  , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of Jesus Christ .  ^\n\nFather Kiernan is initially skeptical of Frankie \' s story  , considering she \'s   an atheist  , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself  , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on .  ^\n\nHe eventually begins to suspect that his boss  , Cardinal Houseman ( Jonathan Pryce  )  , is concealing something that could bring down the Catholic Church .  ^\n\nAs it turns out  , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a  \" fifth gospel  \" before they were excommunicated .  ^\n\nThe new Rupert Wainwright music video . .  .  ^\n\nI mean film  \" Stigmata  \" is the sort of film that starts off OK and only gets worse .  ^\n\nIndeed  , it would have been good if it were a music video  , because it \'s   only interesting for about five minutes .  ^\n\nI \'m   not sure what Wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion  , double-exposure  , and extreme close-ups ( Whoaaaaaa  !  !  !  !  )  , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in Hollywood and  , yes  , he has been to film school .  ^\n\nHis camera trickery is interesting for a little while  , but eventually  , it becomes headache-inducing .  ^\n\nWhat this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is  )  , with Wainwright screaming at the audience  ,  \" See  ?  ^\n\nLook at what I can do  !  ^\n\nI \'m   an EX-cellent dir-ECT-or .  \"  ^\n\nMaybe then he \'d   explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse  , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh  , scary  !  ) .  ^\n\nIf there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery  , I did n\'t   see it .  ^\n\nJust when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story  , here comes a double-exposure shot of two Patricia Arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever .  ^\n\nArrrrrrrghhhh . .  .  ^\n\nThen again  , the superfluous camera trickery would n\'t   bother me if  \" Stigmata  \" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging .  ^\n\nThough Wainwright \'s   vanity certainly does n\'t   help  , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script .  ^\n\nWhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them  ?  ^\n\nCase in point  : Frankie Page is the character that ( I assume  ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with  , but we are n\'t   given any back story on her character  , or any reason to like her .  ^\n\nThe extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building  ) and she \'s   kind of cute  , so let \'s   start the bleeding  !  ^\n\nThe fact that she \'s   clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer does n\'t   help  , either .  ^\n\nAccording to Frankie Page  , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back  ?  ^\n\nGo clubbing  !  ^\n\nSure  , that makes sense .  ^\n\nArquette  , Byrne  , and Pryce give it the old college try  , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking .  ^\n\nScenes between Arquette and Byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat  , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable .  ^\n\nEven though Frankie Page \'s   life is falling apart before her very eyes  , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon .  ^\n\nEven more curiously  , he seems to be interested in her advances .  ^\n\nFather Andrew \'s   religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic .  ^\n\nAs for Pryce  , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle  ,  \" I \'ll   get you  , my pretty  ,  \" for all the depth his Cardinal Houseman is afforded .  ^\n\nTrust me  , I \'m   not revealing anything by telling you Pryce turns out to be a villain .  ^\n\nWhat \'s   worse  , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats  , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction  , veers off in another  , then another  , and ends up being totally incomprehensible .  ^\n\nFirst of all  , the film does n\'t   even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details .  ^\n\nHow does Frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary  ?  ^\n\nHow come an atheist like her was chosen  , since Father Andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata  ?  ^\n\nActually  , I \'m   not sure what Frankie was posessed by .  ^\n\nSupposedly  , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the Holy Spirit  , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest  , and later by some evil spirit ( I think  ) .  ^\n\nWhich one is it  ?  ^\n\nThe answer to this question  , of course  , is very simple  : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work Mr. Wainwright wants to use this time .  ^\n\nFurthermore  , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up  , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the Catholic Church .  ^\n\nIf you do any research at all about the Gospel of St. Thomas  , you \'ll   find that it is not being suppressed by the Church ( as the film seems to claim  )  , but that it is readily available at your local library .  ^\n\nThere \'s   nothing the Catholics need to worry about  , though .  ^\n\n\" Stigmata \'s    \" religion is so off-base that it ca n\'t   be confused for anything remotely resembling the real Catholic Church .  ^\n\nIf they wanted to portray Catholic priests as mobsters  , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns  , which would have been far more interesting .  ^\n\nI \'m   not Catholic  ; in fact  , I don \' t care much for the Catholic Church  , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means .  ^\n\nIt \'s   rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as  \" Stigmata  \" does .  ^\n\nIt \' s not thought-provoking  , though it would like to be  , and it is definitely not scary  , though it pretends to be .  ^\n\nI \'m   not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film  , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story .  ^\n\nMaybe it \'s   an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever .  ^\n\nThe initial shock of seeing Arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over  , and over  , and over .  ^\n\nLike so many films of the MTV generation  , this one suffers from overkill .  ^\n\nSo much is overdone in  \" Stigmata  ,  \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience  , leaving us to pick out the film \'s   ( many  ) flaws .  ^\n\nI \'m   also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the Gospel of St. Thomas is so Earth-shattering .  ^\n\nWhen we finally hear it  , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of Sunday School  , which means that for all its flash  , the whole film is really much ado about nothing .  ^\n\nThe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog  , and  \" Stigmata  \" is it  .'
cv996_12447.txt,'John Boorman \'s    \" Zardoz  \" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own .  ^\n\nNot since the rampant bumblings of one Edward D. Wood Jr. has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time .  ^\n\nOf course  , Wood \'s   career can be explained by two things  : he had no money and he had no talent .  ^\n\nBoorman  , on the other hand  , cannot court such excuses to explain  \" Zardoz  \" ( or his follow-up film  , the equally awful  \" Exorcist II  : The Heretic  \"  ) .  ^\n\nBoorman obviously had a sizable budget  , a matinee idol movie star ( Sean Connery  ) in the lead role  , and although you would n\'t   know it from this film  , Boorman does indeed have talent .  ^\n\nThis is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece  \" Deliverance  \" ( 1972  )  , as well as the autobiographical World War II drama  \" Hope and Glory  \" ( 1987  )  , the slightly over-conceived Arthurian epic  \" Excalibur  \" ( 1981  ) and the father-son jungle adventure  \" The Emerald Forest  \" ( 1985  ) .  ^\n\nHis films all show that Boorman is never lacking in imagination  , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste .  ^\n\nIf Boorman is anything  , he \'s   ambitious  , and when he succeeds  , it \'s   in grand fashion .  ^\n\nUnfortunately  , the bigger they are  , the harder they fall  , and when Boorman falls  , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around .  ^\n\n\" Zardoz  \" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies  , an obsession of Boorman \'s   .^\n\nHis screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the Arthurian legends or even  \" The Wizard of Oz  ,  \" a book which figures into the movie \'s   plot .  ^\n\nBut  , despite all this reaching  , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling .  ^\n\nThe events take place in the distant year 2293  , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found .  ^\n\nIn fact  , things seems to have moved backwards  , with people riding horses  , shooting old-style guns  , and living in large Victorian mansions .  ^\n\nIt \'s   more Middle Ages than Space Age .  ^\n\nThe world of  \" Zardoz  \" is divided into two distinct hemispheres  : the Outlands  , where all the poor  , pathetic people live  , and the Vortex  , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life .  ^\n\nThese Immortals never grow old  , they never engage in sexual activity  , they possess psychological powers  , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian Marxist society where everyone is equal  , and everyone contributes equally to the society .  ^\n\nHowever  , if one breaks the rules  , that person is punished by being aged so many years .  ^\n\nIf someone breaks the rules enough  , he or she is aged to the point of senility  , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals .  ^\n\nOne of the Immortals  , Arthur Frayn ( Niall Buggy   )  , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face  , is charged with keeping order in the Outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the Immortals can be fed .  ^\n\nLike  \" The Wizard of Oz  ,  \" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head .  ^\n\n( This flying head is one of the movie \'s   opening images  , and it \'s   a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come .  )  ^\n\nCalling himself Zardoz  , Frayn gathers a bunch of Outlanders and makes them into a group called the Exterminators  , whose purpose is to kill most of the other Outlanders so they ca n\'t   procreate and take up more resources .  ^\n\nFrom inside his giant  , stone head  , Zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like  ,  \" The gun is good .  ^\n\nThe penis is evil .  \"  ^\n\nThat line alone is worth the movie \'s   cult following .  ^\n\nOne day  , an Exterminator named Zed ( Sean Connery  )  , sneaks into Zardoz \'s   flying stone  , pushes Frayn out  , and goes back to the Vortex .  ^\n\nOnce there  , the Immortals label him a  \" Brutal  \" and study him like a lab rat  , taking great  , perverse care in exploring his sexuality  , which is a mystery to them .  ^\n\nThey seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection  , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show Zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up .  ^\n\nI say  \" hilarious  \" because that is exactly what  \" Zardoz  \" is .  ^\n\nIt is obvious that Boorman did not intend it to be so  ; he made this film with the straightest of faces  , although I have a hard time believing that as production moved forward  , he did n\'t   get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming .  ^\n\nJust looking at Connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper  , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back  , a Wyatt Earp-style handlebar mustache  , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap Hollywood hooker .  ^\n\nBoorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of  \" Deliverance  ,  \" which is the only reason I can imagine a studio would green-light this effort .  ^\n\nHe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera  , including cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth (  \" 2001  \"  )  , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in  \" Zardoz  \" besides the inadvertent humor .  ^\n\nSean Connery had made his last James Bond film in 1971  , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace .  ^\n\nHe got exactly that in  \" Zardoz  ,  \" and it \'s   a wonder it did n\'t   end his career .  ^\n\nI \'m   sure Boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements .  ^\n\nIs it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life  ?  ^\n\nIs it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing  ?  ^\n\nOr is it a social statement  , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates  ?  ^\n\nKarl Marx might like it if he were more like Timothy Leary .  ^\n\nCome to think of it  , maybe Boorman made it as an extended LSD trip .  ^\n\nPeople high on illicit substances are the only ones I can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy .'

cv998_15691.txt,'There was a time when John Carpenter was a great horror director .  ^\n\nOf  course  , his best film was 1978 \'s   masterpiece  ,  \" Halloween  ,  \" but he also  made 1980 \'s    \" The Fog  ,  \" and 1987 \'s   underrated  ,  \" Prince of Darkness .  \"   ^\n\nHeck  , he even made a good film in 1995  , with  \" In the Mouth of Madness .  \"   ^\n\nBut something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992  , with the terrible  comedy  ,  \" Memoirs of an Invisible Man .  \"  ^\n\nSomehow  , Carpenter has lost his  touch  , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of  ,  \" Village of the  Damned  ,  \" to his uninspired 1996 sequel  ,  \" Escape From L.A.  \" Those movies  ,  however  , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film  ,   \" John Carpenter \'s   Vampires .  \"  ^\n\nIf I was him  , I definately would n\'t   want to  put my own name in the title .  ^\n\nIt is a sad state of affairs when  Carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed  as  ,  \" Vampires .  \"  ^\n\nThe story is simple .  ^\n\nJack Crow ( James Woods  ) is a vampire hunter who  ,  along with one of his partners  , Montoya ( Daniel Baldwin  )  , and a  prostitute  , Katrina ( Sheryl Lee  )  , survives an attack from the Master  vampire  , Valek ( Thomas Ian Griffith  ) .  ^\n\nSince Katrina was previously  bitten by him  , Crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by  Valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn  into vampires a couple days later  , and Crow is hoping to find him with  the help of her .  ^\n\nIt seems Valek \'s   mission is to steal a black  , wooden  cross from a Roman Catholic church that will enable him to become so  powerful that sunlight will not destroy him .  ^\n\nMy question is  : how many time have we seen this same story played out  ?   ^\n\nWell  , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the  story has been made .  ^\n\n\" John Carpenter \'s   Vampires  ,  \" sadly enough  , is one  of the most unscary horror films I \'ve   ever seen .  ^\n\nIn fact  , there is n\'t    even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time .  ^\n\nThe  non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed  , without any  interesting camera work  , which is usually a trademark of Carpenter \'s   . ^\n\nAnd then we come to the screenplay  , which  , as far as I can tell  , is  nearly non-existent .  ^\n\nThere is no story development  , and there is n\'t   even  an attempt to flesh out the characters .  ^\n\nJames Woods can be a good actor  , but he has nothing to do here but to  say a couple of  \" pseudo\"-clever lines of dialogue .  ^\n\nDaniel Baldwin has  some potential  , but his character comes off as being very dense .  ^\n\nAnd  Sheryl Lee ( faring much better as Laura Palmer in  \" Twin Peaks  \"  )  , like  all of the female characters  , plays an offensive stereotypical whore .   ^\n\nThere is not an ounce of intelligence  , or excitement in  ,  \" John  Carpenter \'s   Vamires  ,  \" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan  of Carpenter \'s   .^\n\nHe has said that he turned down directing  ,  \" Halloween  :  H20  ,  \" because he could n\'t   work up any excitement for it .  ^\n\nAnd yet  , when  asked about a  \" Vampires  \" sequel  , he said he would be happy to do it .  ^\n\nI  think that \'s   a definite sign that Carpenter has finally lost any trace  of his lasting talent  , not to mention a significant number of IQ points  .'
